# Hop — behavioral specification

Single source of truth for how the app behaves. Any behavior change =
an edit to this file in the same commit. Re-read a module's section
before working on it. Maintained since 2026-07-12, full revision 2026-07-13.

## What it is

Hop is a menu bar multi-tool for macOS: timer, no sleep, system monitor,
clipboard, file converter, window manager. Design in the spirit of interval
(supercommon systems): dark panel, dot-matrix display made of glowing
dots. Open source, fully local: no server, no telemetry, no external
dependencies (system frameworks only).

Name: "hop" — the little word that accompanies a quick, nimble move;
"one click — and everything you need is here, hop — done." The French
"allez hop!" origin is deliberately NOT mentioned in any copy
(Anton's decision). The logo is a glowing asterisk star. The bundle id
stays `com.antonshakirov.minimo` forever; the "Minimo Signing" certificate
and the `~/.minimo-release-key` key are never renamed (permissions and
signing would break).

## Hard invariants of the panel (violation = regression)

1. **The panel always fits on screen.** Any expandable content has
   a height ceiling + internal scrolling (clipboard: ≤430pt). If the panel
   grows taller than the screen, NSPopover relocates to the edge — that is
   the "panel on the right" bug.
2. **The panel does not jump.** The popover anchor is the icon zone
   (`iconAnchor` — the exact image frame from the button cell, so the
   arrow is dead-center on the star). If a menu bar manager (Ice,
   Bartender, Hidden Bar) hides the icon (zero width / off-screen
   window), the panel opens detached at the TOP-RIGHT corner of the
   screen instead of being clamped into the top-left. Re-pinning
   positioningRect: when the button's WINDOW moves (didMove) — always;
   on panel resize — ONLY if origin.x actually moved (>0.5pt).
   Unconditional re-pinning on every resize makes the panel twitch.
3. **The menu bar button width AND the SET of readings are frozen** while
   the panel is open (Anton, 2026-07-15; the set generalised from a single
   bool 2026-08-04). Whichever clocks were speaking at open keep speaking
   until the panel closes, padded with spaces to the frozen length; if the
   digits outgrow the slot (stopwatch passing an hour) the freeze extends
   and the didMove observer re-anchors. **A clock stopped from the panel
   keeps its slot** and shows what it stopped at — a reset timer shows its
   configured duration, a stopped task the total it reached — because the
   space was already padded for it and a vanished reading leaves that
   space standing empty. Figures stay live inside their frozen slots.
   Hidden at open → a clock started from the panel does NOT surface until
   the panel closes; on close the bar reflects reality.
4. **No repeatForever animations** — they trigger NSHostingController
   size recalculation. Icon changes are an opacity crossfade in a
   fixed-size ZStack.
5. **Hover highlights bleed outward, they do not inset the content.** A
   full-width row (the "new task" footers) starts on the panel's own inset, so a
   highlight drawn on the row's exact bounds lands on the first glyph and on the
   panel's border at once. `hoverHighlight(_:bleed:)` grows the shape sideways in
   the BACKGROUND — the layout never moves — instead of padding the row, which
   would push its text off the shared left line (Anton, 2026-07-29).
6. **One horizontal inset for the whole panel.** The container pads 14pt
   left and right and modules add NOTHING of their own: labels, rows,
   cards, dividers and the edges of pill rows all start on the same line.
   Text INSIDE a pill is indented by that pill's own padding, which is the
   only allowed exception. Four modules used to add 2pt for themselves and
   sat two points to the right of every pill above them (fixed 2026-07-29).

5. Content size is fixed BEFORE the popover is shown (layoutSubtreeIfNeeded
   + contentSize); windows are shown via presentCentered (layout BEFORE show).
6. The popover size is rounded UP to whole points (IntegralSizeHostingController
   + integral fittingSize, content top-aligned): fractional SwiftUI text
   heights otherwise land the frame on a half pixel and the header icons
   jiggle 1px between tabs. The header is also STRUCTURALLY immovable: the fixed
   chrome (the "what's new" and 8-hour overrun banners + the header) is a sibling ABOVE the scroll
   region, never inside it, and ONLY the active space's module stack (or the
   settings/about overlay body) scrolls. Chrome and content heights are measured
   separately AND ROUNDED UP to whole points; the scroll region's fixed height is
   `min(contentHeight, maxPanelHeight − chromeHeight)`, so it flexes and clamps
   the whole panel to the screen while the chrome stays put. Whole-point rounding
   matters: the window size is a ceil of the natural panel height, so a
   fractional content height left chrome + content a sub-point shorter than their
   own ceil'd window, and that per-space leftover surfaced as a persistent 1px
   vertical shift of the fixed chrome (the header sat a point lower on taller
   spaces). Feeding whole-point heights makes chrome + content equal the window
   exactly — no leftover to place. Switching to a taller/shorter space changes
   the content height instantly and the measurement trails by one runloop, but
   the header is out of the scroll, so only the scroll region's bottom edge moves
   — the header cannot bob, nor be dragged by a leftover scroll offset (each
   space/overlay gets a fresh scroll identity that starts at offset 0).
6. popover.animates = false; the popover theme follows the setting/system.

## Menu bar icon — corner badges

**The icon's colour follows the MENU BAR, not the app.** A decorated icon is a
bitmap with its glyph colour baked in, drawn from `button.effectiveAppearance` —
the bar can be dark while the app is light (over a full-screen window, or the
instant the system flips), and reading `NSApp` instead left the icon in whichever
colour the bar had when it was last drawn, invisible on the other one (fixed
2026-07-29). A KVO observer on that appearance redraws it. The countdown beside
it never had the problem: AppKit colours a title itself.

The status-item star carries small badges in its four corners, on a fixed
22×17 canvas so the icon never changes width. The composition (which badge,
where) is a pure HopCore function — `IconBadges.compose(IconState) →
IconComposition` — with no AppKit, fully unit-tested (`IconBadgesTests`); the
renderer `MenuBarIcon.compose` only draws what it returns. Corner assignment is
spatial: attention top-left, awake dots top-right, time wedges bottom-right,
torrent arrows bottom-left. **Colours are the documented exception to the
Theme-token rule** — the badges use the fixed Apple system palette so they read
identically on every user's bar.

- **Bottom-right — time wedges.** A green `PlayGlyph` wedge (systemGreen) =
  the ENGINE's time is running — either a countdown timer OR a stopwatch; the
  two are mutually exclusive (one engine slot), so the star never distinguishes
  them (the title's digits already show whether the value falls or climbs).
  A dark-green wedge (opaque `#159E46`, a saturated ~40%-darker systemGreen) =
  a TASK is tracking. A wedge is drawn only while its clock is actually RUNNING
  (a play triangle means "running" — a PAUSED engine shows no wedge) AND only
  when that clock's value is NOT already spelled out as digits in the title (the
  digits are the wedge's redundant twin). So with the countdown ON (default) a
  running timer shows digits and no green wedge, while a tracking task still
  shows its dark-green wedge in the corner. With the countdown OFF both wedges
  can share the corner: green (engine) then dark-green (task), each a squat,
  seated, rounded triangle. The pair reads as a TIGHT pair with only a slight
  overlap (~0.8pt) and the LEFT (engine) wedge drawn on top, so its thin pointed
  tip merely grazes the right wedge's wide base — both stay visually equal and
  full-size (a bigger overlap, or drawing the right one on top and covering the
  left one's apex, made one read smaller). The pair is centred under the awake-dot
  columns within their footprint, and its stride is a whole point so the twins
  rasterise identically. A lone wedge is drawn larger, in the far-right column
  like a lone dot. The impossible "timer + stopwatch" combo cannot be expressed
  (the engine is one value), so a triple never occurs.
- **Top-right — awake dots.** Yellow (systemYellow) = no-sleep active; orange
  (systemOrange) = lid mode applied. They are independent, not a priority — BOTH
  dots can show, a dense row with a light overlap (in 1x they melt into one
  two-colour blob, accepted). A single dot sits in the far corner; a pair grows
  leftward.
- **Top-left — attention "!".** A saturated deep red (`#D81C0C`). Two sources:
  the monitor red zone (opt-in `menuBarRedAlert`) burns STEADILY; a task left
  running past 8h (`TrackerOverrun.isBannerVisible`, same episode/ack logic as
  the panel banner) BLINKS 1s-on/1s-off off the tracker heartbeat. If both are
  active the steady source keeps it lit. Tick-driven only — no `repeatForever`.
- **Corner-dot geometry.** Every corner dot is 5.0pt and hangs off the icon's
  CENTRE by the same distance in every direction (±8.0 across, ±5.5 down), so a
  dot in one corner is the exact mirror of a dot in another. The numbers are the
  only set where all four boxes also land on whole half-points (16.5 / 0.5 and
  11.5 / 0.5), so mirrored dots rasterise identically at 2x instead of one of
  them catching an extra half-pixel of antialiasing. Before this the awake dot
  was 5.2pt and sat 0.4pt further out than the 4.4pt VPN dot below it, which read
  as a crooked pair whenever both were lit (Anton, 2026-07-29).
- **Top-left — the "!".** `systemOrange`, and drawn at the weight of the dots
  around it: a 2.0pt stem with a tittle of the same width, against the 5.0pt
  corner dots. It was `#D81C0C` red at `stroke × 1.15`, which said catastrophe
  for a state that means "a reading is high", and was thin enough to look
  borrowed from another icon set (Anton, 2026-09-05). Orange is the colour a
  stalled tunnel already carries, so the bar has one word for "something is off".
- **Top-left — reminder dot.** A small `systemBlue` disc beside the "!" (in the
  corner itself when the "!" is dark), steady, never blinking: it reports
  something waiting rather than something wrong. Monochrome renders it as an
  outline ring, so it stays distinct from the filled "!". Visible while any to-do
  has an unacknowledged firing. One of the TWO badges with an off switch
  (`todoRemindMark`) — a documented exception to the rule below, because a
  reminder is a one-off user event whose signal belongs to the same family as the
  timer's finish signal, not an app state that is simply true or false.
- **Bottom-left — torrent arrows.** ↓ downloading, ↑ seeding (a FINISHED torrent
  actively uploading), or both side by side — the two can co-occur (one fetching
  while another seeds). Always the star's glyph colour (white/85%-black), the one
  bottom badge that is not green. `TorrentController.menuBarTransfer` supplies the
  two independent booleans. This REPLACES the old ↓/↑ glyph that lived in the
  title (which no longer carries transfer, so it can never shift the panel).
- **Colour vs monochrome.** The setting (general, default ON) reads "colored
  marks on the menu-bar icon" and carries a note saying the corner marks follow
  the state in colour and that off tells them apart by shape — "colored
  indicators" alone named nothing the user could point at (Anton, 2026-09-02).
  It colours the badges. OFF renders every badge in the glyph colour and tells
  the three same-corner pairs apart by SHAPE: no-sleep = filled dot, lid = outline
  ring; engine = filled wedge, task = outline wedge (same outer size as filled);
  a live tunnel = filled dot, a stalled one = outline ring; the "!" and arrows
  stay their single shape. Per-badge on/off switches were
  rejected — a badge always shows while its state is active; only colour is a
  setting. Exactly two badges are exempt and both are named where they are
  described: the reminder dot (`todoRemindMark`) and the VPN dot
  (`vpnMenuBarMark`, in the VPN settings section, ON by default — and gone
  entirely while the VPN module is hidden). A tunnel is
  held by somebody else's app, so whether it is worth a mark is the user's call
  (Anton, 2026-07-29). There is NO on-screen symbol legend — a badge-meaning legend once
  lived in the info window's general tab but was removed (the icon is meant to be
  self-evident; the `colored indicators` toggle is the only badge-related
  surface there).
- **Retired indicators** (absorbed by the above): the yellow moon in the title,
  the hand-drawn tracking mini-stopwatch badge, the stopwatch title glyph, and
  the purple task-time idea (dark-green won). The finish **bell** is unchanged
  (base symbol, still blinks until acknowledged). The dev **"D"** mark
  (bottom-left, suppressed under `--snapshot`) and the template fast path for the
  calm undecorated star both survive. The template path is used only when the
  composition is empty; any badge routes through `compose`.

## What a running clock costs

A running timer used to hold a quarter of a CPU core, whether or not the panel
was open (measured on 1.10.0: 25-33% of a core, panel closed). Three things
made it, and each is a rule now.

- **The heartbeat publishes only what changes.** `TimerEngine` ticks four times
  a second so a countdown ends on time, but `heartbeat` is what the interface
  watches, and publishing it rebuilds every view that reads the model: the whole
  panel, each module in it and the menu-bar label. A running clock shows whole
  seconds, so three of those four ticks changed nothing and cost a full redraw
  each. `TimerEngine.publishes(at:since:fineGrained:)` (`TimerHeartbeatTests`)
  keeps the tick for accuracy and publishes once a second - twice a second only
  in the finished state, where the alarm blink and the calm pulse after it are
  drawn at 2 Hz.
- **A row's text is folded once, not per redraw.** A clipboard entry holds up to
  20 000 characters, and the row label folded all of them into one line on every
  render of every visible row. `ClipboardRules.previewLine`
  (`ClipboardPreviewTests`) stops at the width a row can show, and
  `ClipPreviewCache` keeps the result per entry.
- **The temperature sensors are resolved once.** Reading them re-copied the HID
  service list and every sensor's "Product" name, five seconds apart, all day.
  The list and the names do not change while the app runs, so they are resolved
  on the first reading and only the readings repeat.

Those three cut it fourfold, and the figure they were measured at - 0.8-3.4% of
a core - was taken on an app whose panel had never been shown. Nobody uses Hop
that way. The panel keeps its whole view tree alive from the first time it
opens, so after one click on the icon the same running timer held 12.95% of a
core with the panel closed. Two more rules, and every figure below is taken
after a panel has been opened and closed at least once.

- **A tick reaches the panel only while the panel is on screen.** The clock and
  the tracker publish once a second, and `AppModel` funnels every controller into
  one `objectWillChange`, so one second of the clock rebuilt the whole panel.
  Those two reach the menu-bar label on `clockTicked`, which the label reads
  directly, and the view tree only while `PanelRedraw` (HopCore,
  `PanelRedrawTests`) says the panel is visible. A panel coming back is handed
  the one redraw it owes, so it opens showing the current second rather than the
  one it was closed on.
- **A view that drives itself is the most expensive thing the panel can hold.**
  A schedule of its own owes nothing to the model and walks straight past the
  rule above. The price is not the drawing: the outline around the pause button
  cost the same eight percentage points whether it updated 120 times a second or
  30, because one `NSHostingController` measures the WHOLE panel and any live
  schedule inside it buys a layout pass over every module on every display
  cycle. **The pulse is gone** (Anton, 2026-09-07): `RunningRing` is a plain
  outline at full strength, and half of what an open panel cost went with it.
  Handing the pulse to a `CABasicAnimation` on a layer was tried and measured
  and did work, but an effect that has to leave SwiftUI to be affordable is an
  effect the panel should not carry — and an `NSViewRepresentable` renders in a
  `--snapshot` as a yellow block, which took the pause button with it. Ask the
  same of anything holding a `TimelineView`, a `Timer.publish` or an animation
  that outlives the event that started it.

- **The panel hears a second only when the second is not all that changed.**
  `AppModel` funnels every controller into one `objectWillChange` and `PanelView`
  is a single view, so one tick rebuilt every module on the panel to move two
  figures. `TimerEngine.signature` is everything the engine publishes EXCEPT the
  heartbeat (`ClockSignatureTests`), and a change reaches the panel only when
  that differs - a new `@Published` on the engine belongs in it. The digits are
  the one thing that does move every second, so `TimerReadout` watches the clock
  itself; the finish blink, the settled pulse and the tooltip went with it,
  because a tooltip reading the parent's state reports the second the panel was
  last rebuilt on rather than the one it is showing.

- **Every module keeps to this, not only the clock.** A module publishing while
  nobody is looking rebuilds the panel exactly as a tick did: one torrent loaded
  held 4.23% of a core with the panel SHUT, against 0.8% at rest. The engine is
  polled about once a second whatever it answers, so this is the module's own
  price and not the transfer's. The eight that live only in
  the panel (keep-awake, updates, the speed test, torrents, the tracker, to-dos,
  the eyedropper, the keyboard lock) reach the view tree through `PanelRedraw`.
  The four with windows of their own (the converter, recognition, archives and
  the archive helper) do not - those windows stay open with the panel shut and
  read the model. The menu bar shows a little of every module and reads
  `barChanged`, which the gate never touches. `PanelRedraw` counts surfaces BY
  NAME (`PanelRedrawTests`): the popover and the settings window are the same
  `PanelView`, either one on screen keeps the panel drawn, and a surface
  reporting itself twice cannot leave the panel frozen. Measured with a torrent
  running, panel shut: 4.23% before, 1.07% after.

Measured on a release build with the same timer running: 2.3% of a core with the
panel open and 2.4% with it closed, one sitting on a busy machine - an open panel
no longer costs more than a closed one, because neither is redrawn for a second
passing. The open figure was 7.0% before this rule and 15.1% before the pulse
went. Figures taken in different sittings are not comparable - the same build
reads 1.2% on a quiet machine and 2.4% under load. A comparison is two builds
measured side by side in one window, which is what `ps -o time=` deltas on both
pids give.

## Onboarding

**Only a fresh install sees it.** An update is not a first run: somebody who has
been using Hop has an arrangement of their own, and a wizard with no close button
would stand in front of it and switch every module back on. `onboardingDone`
alone cannot answer this — the key has never been written on a Mac updating from
1.10.0 or earlier, so it reads false for exactly the people who must not see the
wizard. `FirstRun.isFresh` (HopCore, `FirstRunTests`) reads the app's own
persistent domain for the marks an older version is certain to have left
(`panelTabs`, `canonicalLayoutSeeded`, the per-release `newsSeen.` /
`featureSeen.` / `permissionsReset.` flags, and the rest of `FirstRun.marks`);
finding any of them, the launch writes `onboardingDone` itself and the wizard
never opens. The domain is read at the TOP of
`applicationDidFinishLaunching`, before this run leaves marks of its own.

**A wizard left halfway is not an update.** The wizard leaves marks of its own the
moment it appears: every module is seeded on, which writes the arrangement, and
`onboardingSeededAllOn` is set. Read as an earlier version's marks, they finished
the wizard on the next launch, so a new install that quit the wizard, or took the
restart that follows granting a permission, lost it and met the release card
instead (found 2026-09-10, present since 2.0.0). The launch therefore asks
`FirstRun.needsWizard` (`FirstRunTests`): `onboardingDone` answers no; otherwise a
fresh domain, a stored `onboardingStep` or `onboardingSeededAllOn` answers yes,
and only a domain with none of the three is an update.

A wizard, one thing per screen, in an 880×700 window that has no close button:
onboarding is finished, not dismissed. It opens dead centre of the screen, and
holds that position: `isRestorable` is off and the centring repeats on the next
run-loop turn, because AppKit restores a titled window's last position and
cascades new windows off the previous one, and either one moves it. Quitting the
app does not end it: the step is stored (`SettingsKey.onboardingStep`) and the
window reopens on it, which is also what makes granting a permission survivable.
macOS answers a permission question once per process, hop restarts to ask again,
and the wizard comes back where it was.

The order (`OnboardStep.ordered`): **hop** (language, theme, launch at login) →
**nothing leaves this Mac** (the same pledge the permissions page carries, plus
one card saying the app is free, has no paid tier and lives on donations) → the
**module groups** → **layout** → **permissions** → **done**.

**The layout screen** (Anton, 2026-09-16). Right after the modules are chosen,
one screen shows the panel's tabs as columns and lets them be arranged at once:
a module dragged onto another tab, a column dragged to move the tab itself. It is the table of settings → modules and
tabs itself (`PanelView(layoutTableOnly:)`), not a picture of it, so what is
learned here is what settings show later; the grids of apps, their options and
the one-row switch stay on the settings page. The heading says it can be done
now or later, in settings. Tabs emptied by the module screens are dropped when
the step opens (`dropEmptyOnboardingSpaces`), so no blank column stands in it;
the same cleanup still runs at the end. A grid of apps chosen in the wizard is
created at the end, so it is not on this screen yet. **The wizard's table only
moves things** (Anton, 2026-09-17): no power button and no ✕ on a grid of apps.
Which modules are on was decided on the screens just before, and switching
one on here would also ask for permissions ahead of their own step; the power
button stays in settings, where arranging and switching go together. A module
switched off earlier stands dimmed in its column and can still be placed.

- The groups are `ModuleCatalog.onboardingGroups`, tested to cover every module
  exactly once: time (timer, tracker, to-dos) · files (converter, archives) ·
  screen and clipboard (clipboard, eyedropper, recognition) · the Mac itself
  (monitor, sleep block, keyboard lock) · network (speed, vpn, torrents) ·
  everyday things (windows, apps, uninstaller). Each row is the module's icon,
  its name, the one-line `purpose*` the settings pages already use, and a switch.
  Sixteen switches on a single page said nothing about what any of them did.
- **The switches write through immediately** (`activateStoredModule` /
  `deactivateStoredModule`), rather than being collected and applied at the end.
  A restart in the middle of the wizard would otherwise lose every answer given
  before it.
- The permissions step embeds the settings window's own `PermissionsView`, so
  there is one list of permissions in the app rather than two.
- **A theme chip answers at once.** `applyAppTheme(refreshIcon:)` splits the
  cheap work (windows, the menu-bar icon, a redraw) from writing the Dock icon,
  which goes through `NSWorkspace.setIcon` into the bundle: measured at 620–850ms
  per call on this Mac, so three clicks through the chips cost over two seconds
  of frozen main thread (Anton, 2026-09-05). The onboarding never writes it — the
  finish does, once — and everywhere else the write is debounced by 0.5s.
- "apps" is not a module until a grid exists, so its answer is kept in
  `SettingsKey.onboardingWantsApps` and the grid is made at the end.
- Finishing marks every "what's new" announcement and release card seen: a fresh
  install has no release to catch up on.

**The screens are centred and sit on a live backdrop** (Anton, 2026-09-05): the
dot grid the timer's display is built from, spread across the window, with two
slow waves crossing it and the light gathering where the screen's subject is.
It runs on a `TimelineView` at 12fps rather than a `repeatForever` animation,
which this codebase does not use. It is deliberately faint — at full strength it
was read through the permissions screen's paragraphs and made them hard to
follow — but it has a FLOOR: both the falloff from the focus and the wave keep a
dot at three quarters of its own strength at worst, so the field is present in
every corner instead of leaving black holes where the wave is at its trough
(Anton, 2026-09-06). The footer carries no bar of its own: a strip with its own
background under the wizard read as a second surface (Anton, 2026-09-05). **The welcome screen arrives a piece at a
time** — the star, the name, the line under it, then the language card, each
fading up from 14pt below over 0.45 s. One orchestrated moment, on the first
screen only: nothing else in the wizard moves, and a snapshot renders the
finished state. A permission row keeps its state in a column of its own, so the
description wraps before it rather than running on under "asked when used", and
the closing "what Hop never does" carries a shield and stands off from the rows
above it. The last screen carries two texts, not three: the heading states
that hop is already running, and the line under it says how to open the panel and
that any module can be switched and reordered in settings.
The privacy screen says its three claims as rows with their own marks — nothing
collected, no sign-up, open source — with the full
pledge under them in small type: a paragraph of that length was skipped.

The wizard's window is created at its final size and its final place, before it
is ordered in. Three things had to be true at once for that (Anton, 2026-09-06):
the contentRect is computed around the screen's centre rather than at (0, 0),
which is the bottom-left CORNER; `NSScreen.main` is nil while an accessory app
has no key window, so the fallback is `NSScreen.screens.first`; and handing the
window an `NSHostingController` collapses its frame to the SwiftUI view's
not-yet-measured size — zero — after which the view settles on a size of its own
a frame later. `setContentSize` plus `layoutIfNeeded` force that measurement
while the window is still invisible, so what is centred and shown is the frame it
keeps. Verified by logging the frame at creation, at ordering and one run-loop
turn later: all three read the same rect.

**The picture on a group screen is the module itself**, drawn by the panel's own
code (`PanelView(previewModule:)`) and made unclickable. Not a screenshot: it
follows the language and the theme picked two screens earlier without anything
being re-rendered, and it cannot drift from what the panel actually looks like
(Anton, 2026-09-05). **Every module gets its own picture, beside its own row**:
the module at the panel's real 368pt, so the row shows what the switch is about.
Scaled down to a 170pt thumbnail first, it was a grey blur; the window grew
instead. One picture per screen said nothing about the two modules under it.

**A picture is whole, and it is nothing but the picture** (Anton, 2026-09-05):
no frame of its own, no fixed height and no crop, so it ends where the module
ends. A frame taller than what it held showed a band of empty black under every
short module, and a frame shorter than its module cut a row in half. Nothing is
scaled down either — the windows draw at 368pt like the panel does, so their text
is the same size as everywhere else. The monitor is the one exception: eight metrics
with a chart each would take the screen, so its picture shows the two that
answer "is this Mac busy" — the processor and memory, with their charts — and
nothing else.

The three modules whose panel row is only a button — the converter, the archiver
and the uninstaller — show the WINDOW they open instead, since the row itself
says nothing. In a picture those windows drop their drop plate, their buttons and
their settings rows: what is left is the result, which is the whole point.
Recognition and the keyboard lock get a DRAWN picture instead
(`OnboardingArt.swift`): a window of recognized text does not show that the text
came off the screen, and a row of durations does not show a locked keyboard. So
recognition is a picture with a marquee across part of it and the lines that came
out of it beside it, and the lock is a keyboard of dimmed keys with a lock over
them. **The two markup modules are drawn too** (Anton, 2026-09-08): their
panel rows are a line of words apiece and say nothing about either.

What the two pictures draw is what the app itself puts on the screen, redrawn
small (Anton, 2026-09-09; the first pass invented a dashed yellow frame the
picker has never drawn). The screenshot is the capture overlay as it stands: the
screen veiled outside the chosen pixels, a white hairline just beyond them, the
anchor dot at the corner the drag started from, and the dark size readout below
— then, beside it, what came out with four tools on it, one to a line, each in
an ink the toolbar offers. The drawing layer is TWO displays, because
`MarkupOverlayWindow` opens one window per screen and the line beside the picture
promises every monitor: each carries the yellow border of the mode and its own
tag, and the marks lie over what was already there, the loupe among them.

**A group carries the name of its own screen** (`ModuleCatalog.OnboardingGroup`,
2026-09-08). The wizard's screens and their headings used to be two lists paired
by position: a group added to one and not the other wore its neighbour's name,
and the last group — the window zones, the app grids, the uninstaller — fell off
the end of the pairing and was never shown at all. The title's key now travels
with the group.

**Every picture shows the module at work, never its empty plate** (Anton,
2026-09-05): a drop zone, an add button or a row of durations says what you can
press, not what the module is for. So the timer is counting down, the keyboard
is locked with time left on it, a torrent is downloading at 69%, the converter
has finished two files with their new sizes beside them, the archiver has one
archive unpacked and one packed, recognition shows the text it read, and the
uninstaller shows the caches it found with a size each. The windows those four
modules open drop their drop plate in a picture (`preview: true`) and start at
the result. Staged content fills the rest: two rows in the clipboard and three
picked colours in the app's own accents, different sample tasks for the tracker
and the to-do list (`onbSample*`, ×10), and the launcher's grid of everyday
apps, eight of them so it stays one row.

**Every module starts switched ON in the wizard**, the opt-in ones (the
eyedropper, recognition, the vpn list, torrents) included: the wizard is where a
person decides what to keep, and switching something off is easier than finding
what was never offered (Anton, 2026-09-06). The seeding runs once, behind
`onboardingSeededAllOn`, so the permissions step's restart does not undo what was
switched off before it. Leaving torrents on means the engine is fetched once the
wizard closes, which is what its footnote says.

**Nothing is announced over the panel until the wizard is done.** The
announcement banner and the release cards both return nil while `onboardingDone`
is false: they exist for people who updated INTO a feature, and a fresh install
is being asked the same questions by name a screen away (Anton, 2026-09-06).
Finishing the wizard marks every announcement and release card seen, as before,
so the two rules together mean a new install never sees either.

**The wizard is the only thing on screen, restart included.** A permission
granted from the wizard restarts hop, and the restart used to reopen the settings
window on top of the wizard: the pending section is now consumed and ignored
while onboarding is unfinished. Verified with a stored step 9 and a pending
section: the wizard came back on step 9, one window, and the pending key was
spent (Anton, 2026-09-06).

**A module that ships with a hotkey says so under its description**, one line:
the label plus the combination, read from `HotkeyManager` so a rebound key shows
the user's own (Anton, 2026-09-06). The window zones name none — eighteen actions
do not fit a line — and the modules whose action ships without a combination show
nothing rather than an empty promise.

The description under a module's name is the opening paragraph of its handbook
text rather than the one-line `purpose`: the short line did not answer "what is
this for?" (Anton, 2026-09-05). **That opening paragraph says what the module
lets you do, with the formats and the figures in it** (Anton, 2026-09-05): "and
nothing starts on its own: what you add waits until you press the button" states
what any button already states, while "unpacks zip, rar, 7z, tar, tar.gz,
tar.bz2, tar.xz and gz" answers whether the module is worth switching on. Every
module's opening was rewritten this way in every language; the bullets under it
keep the detail. A long opening is cut at the end of a
sentence — a period FOLLOWED BY A SPACE, since cutting at any period ended the
archiver's format list in the middle of "tar.gz" (Anton, 2026-09-06) — and a very
short one keeps the purpose line in front of it.

The data behind it is staged and lives nowhere else. `AppModel(preview: true)`
builds a second set of controllers with `demo: true`, which read nothing of the
user's and write nothing back: the clipboard shows three rows that need no
translation (a link, a path and a copied file, with the eyedropper's colours
below them, out of the clipboard's own picture and into the one the eyedropper
draws from the same history), the monitor takes one live reading plus an hour
of staged history (cpu load and throughput are deltas between two readings, so
the sample's own figures come from the staged curve rather than showing a dash;
the history is collected every five seconds, like a running Mac's, because one
point a minute drew as a straight line in the five-minute window the chart opens
with, and it is measured back from the newest point so the figure the row shows
is a middling one; the staged curve keeps growing while the wizard is open, since
a fixed hour of history ages out of that window in five minutes and leaves an
empty panel; each metric has a shape of its own — the processor spikes, the
graphics card wakes up twice an hour, memory fills and is released, the network
arrives in bursts — because one set of waves drew four charts that looked like
copies of each other), the internet row carries a fresh staged measurement of its own
rather than whatever the user last measured, which may be a month old and drawn
faded, and the tracker and to-dos start empty. Nothing in a picture runs a
countdown: a timer left running finishes and starts blinking at whoever is still
reading the screen. **The VPN picture
reads the user's own configurations once**, capped at two rows and falling back
to the two staged ones on a Mac with none: nothing there starts a tunnel, opens
a vendor's app or runs a timer. Writing demo data into the real stores and
clearing it afterwards was the alternative, and it leaves fake rows behind the
moment somebody quits mid-wizard.

## Modules

The main screen shows the modules of the selected space (tab) as a stack,
in the order the user set. **A module always sits on exactly one space and
carries a `hidden` flag there** (`PanelTabsModel.hidden`): the flag changes
nothing about where the module lives, only whether it is on. The power button in
"modules & tabs", the item in a module's right-click menu and the "enable the
module" switch on its page are one switch with one answer.

**A module that is off is off everywhere** (Anton, 2026-09-05). It is not drawn
in the panel; its page shows the switch and its documentation and no settings;
its badge and its digits are gone from the menu bar; its key is not claimed, so
the combination is free for another module to take; and what it used to collect
while nobody was looking is not collected — the clipboard watches no pasteboard,
the monitor measures nothing and keeps no history, the tunnel list is not read,
and no reminder banner is armed. Nothing is deleted: the history, the tasks, the
downloads and the settings are exactly where they were when it comes back on.

This replaced the rule of 2026-09-02, under which a hidden module kept answering
its key — "a key that quietly stops working is a bug from where the user sits".
The key no longer stops quietly: the switch says "enable the module" rather than
"show in the panel", and switching one off that is busy says first what that
will stop (see "Switching a module off" below). The setting that used to hand
combinations back to other applications stays gone; the module's own switch is
what decides now.

### Switching a module off

The switch is in three places and they are one answer: the power button on the
module's chip in "modules & tabs" (green = on), the item in a module's
right-click menu in the panel, and "enable the module" on its page.

**A module that is busy says what stopping it will do, and waits.** The rule is
`ModuleShutdown` in HopCore (pure, tested); the app fills in an `Activity` from
its controllers. A module that is idle is switched off on the spot — a question
with nothing behind it only teaches people to click through the ones that have
something behind them.

| module | busy when | what the question says, and what then happens |
|---|---|---|
| timer | counting down or paused | the countdown stops (`reset`, back to what it was set to) |
| awake | sleep prevention active | the Mac may sleep again (`deactivate`) |
| tracker | a task is being timed | the open stretch is closed INTO the task's history (`stopActive`) — the run itself is not committed, the ✓ still owns that |
| torrent | at least one transfer is not paused | every torrent is paused and the engine is stopped; switching the module back on does NOT resume them |
| convert / archive | a job is running | nothing is killed: neither has a cancel, so the job finishes in the window it is already showing in |
| todos | a reminder is still ahead | reminders stay in the list and stop ringing |

Every other module is switched off without a word: nothing of theirs is in
flight. Nothing anywhere is deleted — history, tasks, downloads, colours and
settings are all where they were.

The confirmation is the same scrim-and-card the deletions use, over the panel
and over the settings window alike, with cancel on the leading edge (Escape) and
"turn off" on the trailing one. It is not red: nothing is being destroyed.

**The default layout, from 2026-09-05:** space 1 is the tools, space 2 is
everything that REPORTS — the monitor, the speed test and the torrents
(`PanelTabsModel.reportingModules`) — space 4 is what works ON files
(`toolModules`: the archiver, the uninstaller and the eyedropper, Anton
2026-09-06; the converter is reached often enough to stay on space one, and the
window zones sit at the bottom of it) — and space 3 is the tracker with the
to-dos. The speed test and the torrents used to sit on space 1, which carried
every tool plus them. A reporting space survives as long as any one of its three
is on. The window zones also ship as one row rather than the grid
(`windowsLayout` defaults to `row`); an install that already exists is written
`grid` once at launch, so nobody's panel changes shape under them.

**The fourth space carries `tray`, not a tool** (Anton, 2026-09-07). Its three
neighbours are one closed shape each — `house`, `display`, `clock` — and a tool
glyph reads as denser than all of them at the same size. A tool also promises a
theme the space has not got: an uninstaller and an eyedropper are not what a
wrench does. Only the DEFAULT moved. A panel already saved keeps the icon it
has, and the icon picker is where anyone who wants another one gets it.

Older versions spelled hidden differently: the module was parked in an
"inactive" bucket off the spaces. That bucket is still decoded and
`liftInactiveIntoHidden` puts its contents back on the first space as hidden —
exactly what the user saw before the update. The conversion runs on every load
rather than behind a one-shot flag, so it cannot be missed or replayed, and
nothing is ever written back into the bucket.

**What "off" costs the app to honour** (`ModuleActivation`, one read of the
stored arrangement, cached against the stored text itself): the hotkey refresh
asks it for the whole inactive set, the menu bar asks on every redraw, and four
collectors start and stop with it — the clipboard's one-second pasteboard poll,
the monitor's five-second sampler (its history is dropped, an hour with a hole
in it is a curve that never happened), the tunnel list's `scutil` reads, and the
reminder banners. The collectors are not SwiftUI views, so they listen for
`ModuleActivation.didChange`, which is posted from every place a module is
switched: the panel, the stored-module helpers, the end of onboarding, and once
at launch after the migrations have run.

The settings window is a 220pt sidebar and a page (`SettingsSidebar`,
`SettingsSelection`). The sidebar lists the sections first — "general" (theme,
language, launch, sounds, app icon, the `colored indicators` toggle for the
menu-bar badges, the Dock switch), "modules & tabs" for the panel layout,
"hotkeys", "app permissions" and "updates" — then every module of
`ModuleCatalog` in panel order, each with its icon and name
(`ModulePresentation`). A row wraps onto a second line rather than truncating:
the longest module names in German and French do not fit 220pt on one. A module's page carries its heading with a one-line
"what it is for" (`purpose*`, ×10 — the onboarding cards will read the same
keys), an **"enable the module"** switch holding exactly the state the power
button on the chip holds (one answer, in the two places somebody looks for it),
its own options
(`moduleSettings`, keyed by the same identifier), the hotkey of its "open" action — but only when something answers that key, since a
recorder for an action with no handler would promise what it cannot do — then
**"how it works"**: the module's full documentation under its settings
(`ModulePresentation.howKeys` → the `doc*Full` strings, ×10, rendered by
`DocView` with its bullets, bold terms and inline `{sym:…}` icons; the monitor
takes three of them and the converter two), and last a
link to the guide on the site. From a MODULE's page that link carries the letter
of THAT module alone — it sits under that module's own documentation, and a page
about all sixteen is not what was asked for (Anton, 2026-09-02); the handbook's
link keeps the full code, one letter per module the user still sees
(`ModuleCatalog.guideCode`, letters fixed forever by
`hop-website/docs/guide-code.md`, tested). Both carry the site's own language
when it has one.

**A module that is off shows nothing but its switch and its documentation**
(Anton, 2026-09-05). Switching it off takes its options off the page, and the
hotkey row with them: settings for something that does not run are settings
nobody can act on, and leaving them in place was what made the switch read as
"hide the row" rather than "turn this off". What stays is the heading, the
switch, "how it works" and the link to the guide — the page still says what the
module would do for somebody deciding whether to bring it back. The rule under
the switch is drawn only for modules that own settings at all
(`ModuleCatalog.modulesWithSettings`, tested): the speed test, recognition, the
keyboard lock and the uninstaller carry the switch alone, and used to draw a
hairline over empty space.

Two settings stayed off
the module pages because they are not about one module: the grids of apps (made,
renamed and removed on "modules & tabs", the only module a person creates
themselves) and "the converter and the archives in one row", which says how the
panel draws three modules rather than what any of them does. The window is 940×640,
resizable, minimum 820×480; the sidebar scrolls with the page. The section ids
of the old chip switcher still work in `--settings-section`: "timer" and
"monitor" open those two module pages. The "modules & tabs" section is
ONE combined table, a single row of columns: the space columns in order, then a
compact square "+" add-tab tile aligned to the TOP of its slot while under the
space cap (it was a full-height dashed column before — the stretch was dropped;
the revert is a one-liner noted in `addColumnStub`). Module chips (name,
lowercase) stack vertically in every column; a hand-rolled drag moves a chip
between columns and within a column (`move`/`reorder`) — placement only, since
the power button on the chip is the on/off control: the bare `power` glyph, green
while the module runs and grey once it is off, with the chip's name dimmed
alongside it. It was drawn in a circle at first (`power.circle.fill`), which read
as a smiley rather than a switch, and both states were grey, so neither said
which was which (Anton, 2026-09-05). A dotted ring for the off state was tried
next and read as a loading spinner; one glyph in two colours is what stayed.
While a chip is dragged, a live insertion
indicator marks exactly where it will land: a 2pt horizontal line with rounded
caps in the shared `Theme.editing` accent (the same yellow/goldenrod token the
timer digit-group highlight uses) between the rows of the target column
(top/bottom for first/last, and centred in an empty column); the target column
also tints while hovered. The indicator's position is read from the SAME
resolver that commits the drop (`insertIndex(for:in:at:)` → `SettingsDropGeometry`,
ONE shared stacked resolver for every column), so line and landing can never
disagree. Which column a point falls in is `SettingsDropGeometry.columnID(at:)`
(containment wins, else nearest by X), tested in `SettingsDropGeometryTests`. Each space column header carries
the space icon (a padded icon+chevron control with breathing room around the
hover highlight — tap it or its rotating disclosure chevron to open the icon
picker), "#N", and — on every space but the FIRST — a delete xmark that is
always visible, not hover-only, so what a column can do is on the page rather
than under the pointer (Anton, 2026-09-02). It opens a delete confirmation
(`delete this tab? its modules move to the end of the tab on its left` +
cancel/delete); confirming appends them to the space on its left, keeping
whatever visibility they had. The icon picker is an anchored popover under the header
control (the settings window is a real NSWindow, so a popover is safe here,
unlike the status-bar panel): a scrollable grid, ~7 columns, capped ~320pt
tall, of the curated SF Symbols catalog (`IconCatalog`, 200+ symbols grouped
by theme — home, time, work, media, and so on — with each group set off by
extra vertical spacing rather than a label to avoid a per-group translation;
every name resolves on macOS 14). It dismisses on outside click, Escape, or a
pick, and never reflows the table; a drag in progress cannot open it. The
delete confirmation is an overlay ON the table — a dimmed scrim plus a
centered card — so the columns never reflow beneath it; the scrim tap or
Escape cancels. Dragging a space column header horizontally reorders spaces
(`moveTab`, committed on release against the measured column frames), with a
vertical `Theme.editing` insertion line marking the landing slot while dragging
(read from the same `columnID(at:)` target the move commits to). Column-drag
and chip-drag never fight: the header and the chips are separate grab zones.
The page beside the 220pt sidebar is 720pt wide, so the space columns and the
"+" tile read comfortably across one row; chips truncate with `lineLimit(1)` in
every column. Under the table sits an airy tertiary caption
(`modulesTableHint`, ×10) stating what the power button does — the module keeps
its place, stops running and leaves the panel — and that both columns (to reorder tabs) and the
chips inside them (between/within columns) are draggable. Below the caption sit
the grids of apps (rename, the icon-name switch, ✕) and the
"converter and archives in one row" switch. The in-panel
`.settings` screen is unreachable (never set outside `init`, which always
pairs it with the standalone window), so the table is designed for that
window only. A module can also be re-homed from the panel: right-click it for
"move to" (one item per OTHER space, omitted when there is no other) and "turn
the module off" — which asks first when the module is busy, exactly as the
settings switch does. A module that is off is not rendered, so there is no
inverse "on" context menu — that is the power button in settings. The divider between
modules sits exactly in the middle: top inset = bottom inset = 16pt.
- **The rule is `HopCore.ModuleVisibility`** and takes exactly three inputs: the
  hidden set, the torrent count, and the "show the card without downloads"
  preference. Torrent is the one module with an extra condition — with zero
  torrents its row is hidden unless the preference keeps it — and that condition
  used to ALSO require the engine installer to be exactly `.installed`. That made
  the user's answer conditional on machinery they never asked about: on the first
  launch after an update, while the engine downloaded, or after a failed fetch,
  the row returned to a panel where it had been switched off (Anton, 2026-07-27,
  straight after updating to 1.5.1). The engine no longer gets a vote — "do not
  show this without downloads" is an answer about the row.

### Timer

- **The clock never moves.** Presets and cycle templates sit BELOW the display
  and the play button, and the timer ↔ stopwatch toggle is always at the trailing
  edge of the clock row. They used to sit above, with the toggle travelling in the
  presets row, so switching to the stopwatch — which has no presets — dragged the
  clock, the play button and the toggle upward at once (Anton, 2026-07-29). In the
  large layout the toggle rides at the end of the transport row, mirrored by an
  invisible copy on the left so the play button stays centred; that copy is
  `allowsHitTesting(false)`, since an invisible live button is a trap.

- Counts toward a target date (`Date`), not by decrementing: it doesn't
  drift and survives Mac sleep. The panel can be closed — the countdown
  continues (ticker in TimerEngine).
- Presets: user-defined, edited in settings ("N ×" chips). In idle a preset
  sets the duration; during a countdown it puts the active timer into the
  stash, and the ↩ button restores and resumes it. There is one stash slot
  and it gets overwritten; deliberately starting a new timer clears the stash.
  In the UI the feature is labeled "restore the previous timer" — the
  "pocket" metaphor was dropped as unclear (Anton, 2026-07-14).
- Work-rest cycle presets: "work/rest×rounds" (e.g. 25/5×4);
  the section header is "work-rest cycles"; cards and digits are the same
  size as the time presets (font 11, NumericField 44×24).
- Time input: scrubbing on the display and per-digit-group entry. Scrubbing
  works in ALL display styles (dots/text/units) identically: the digit-group
  zone is computed from the display's actual width (`TimerDigits`, tested), with
  the same ratchet tick sound — TEN a second at most, because at thirty a fast
  drag turned the ratchet into a high whine (Anton, 2026-07-30). A brighter,
  denser ratchet (Tink at twenty) was tried on 2026-08-31 and rejected: the
  original Pop click is the ratchet. In the "units" style without hours the
  display splits in half (minutes/seconds).
- **The selected digit group lights up** (dots style, idle or finished, timer
  only): a click or a drag selects a group and its DOTS turn yellow — in both
  themes, with no plate and no tinted background behind them (Anton,
  2026-08-31). That glow is the only thing saying the keyboard now types into
  that group. Hovering does not select anything: a pale hover plate was tried
  the same day and rejected. The selection does outlive the pointer by ONE
  second after it leaves the digits (two felt slow — Anton, 2026-08-31), and
  every typed digit or backspace starts that second over, so a number being
  entered from the keyboard never loses its group mid-word. Esc and Return still
  end the entry at once. **The minimum is zero**: 0:00:01 is valid; "−5" and
  scrubbing clamp to zero; pressing play with an all-zero value is an
  instant finish. TimerEngine.minimumDuration = 0. Scrubbing is disabled
  during a countdown.
- ±5 ("min" capsules) work while running; "−5" while running drives to
  0 → finish; `targetDate` is @Published, the UI doesn't wait for the ticker.
- Finish: signal per setting (sound+banner / sound / silent). Every banner in
  the app goes through `Alerts.fire`, and every caller supplies BOTH a title and
  a body. The helper still owns a default pair for the timer, but a caller that
  passes only a title inherits it: that is how a finished torrent came to
  announce itself with "the timer has finished" over the torrent's own name
  (Anton, 2026-07-26). Torrent banners are built from `HopCore.TorrentBanner`,
  a value with no unset case — the title is the torrent's name and the body is
  one of three: "%@ downloaded · sharing continues" while it keeps seeding,
  "%@ downloaded" when it is already paused, and "sharing finished · %@ given
  back" the once the seeding policy stops it at ratio 1. The size quoted on
  completion is `progressBytes`, what actually landed on disk, since a partial
  file selection makes the nominal total a different number from the one the
  user can find in Finder. The finish
  sound plays EXACTLY ONCE (no repeat). The zeroed digits blink and a bell
  blinks in the menu bar — opening the panel acknowledges it
  (`TimerEngine.acknowledgeFinish`): the bell settles to a steady lit bell, but
  the zeroed digits keep a subtle pulse (`isFinishSettled`) as a "reset me" cue
  until a reset or a new start ends the finished state. Play from finished
  restarts the same duration.
- Stopwatch: ⏱ icon to the right of the presets, counts up. In the menu bar it
  shares the engine's green wedge with the timer (see "Menu bar icon — corner
  badges") — no separate stopwatch glyph. Mode switching is allowed from idle/finished/PAUSED
  (paused = "already stopped", so discarding an unfinished timer is
  deliberate); while running — a pulsing hint "press pause first".
  The switch does NOT depend on preset row visibility: with the preset row
  hidden it lives as a thin row (in the compact layout — in the same row
  as the timer); hiding the presets doesn't change the display style.
- Insignificant leading digit groups are dimmed (like interval's "00:").
- Display formats (dots/text/units): previews in settings show digits of
  equal height; the "digit size" setting (large/small) applies to
  ALL formats and both layouts, small ≈ half the large size
  (full view: dots 8.6/5.6, text 62/33, units 52/29; compact
  row: dots 5.3/2.9, text 29/15.5, units 25.5/13.7). The compact sizes are
  capped so the worst-case row — [start · reset · spacer · display ·
  stopwatch] with `00:00:00` at "large" — fits the 340pt content width with
  a few pt of margin (39 dot columns × 5.3 ≈ 207 + ≈122pt of chrome ≈ 329);
  the full display sits alone in its row at the panel-width ceiling. Digit-
  group gestures compute the cell from the actual size. The format setting
  is labeled "timer format".
- Dot glow is proportional to dot size; on small cells (dot < 3px,
  mini previews) the glow and the background grid of "off" dots are not
  drawn — otherwise everything smears into noise.
- Transport: the play/pause button is a circle; play draws the house rounded
  `PlayGlyph` (see "Play glyph"), pause SF `pause.fill`.

### No sleep (awake)

- Keeps the Mac awake: downloads/processes aren't interrupted. Options
  15/30 min, 1/2/4/8 h, ∞ (turning it on without an option = ∞); the hour
  letter in the chips is localized (key unitHour), the ∞ glyph is raised
  1pt toward the optical center. In the panel: a moon that turns yellow while
  active + compact remaining time (29m / 1h59m, unit letters localized);
  clicking the moon turns it off. In the menu bar it shows as a yellow corner
  dot (see "Menu bar icon — corner badges"), not a title glyph.
- IOPM assertion: PreventUserIdleSystemSleep by default (the display may
  sleep); "display stays on" → PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep.
- Lid: an icon button next to the moon (while awake is active). Enabling
  runs `pmset disablesleep 1` via AppleScript with administrator privileges:
  **the administrator password prompt comes from macOS itself — it is
  a system requirement, independent of signing or Developer ID.** Turning
  awake off, quitting the app, and time expiry restore sleep
  (`disablesleep 0`); switching duration options keeps lid mode. Lid mode
  never outlives the awake session — without it a closed lid would block
  sleep forever.
- While lid mode is active, closing the lid blanks the built-in panel:
  `disablesleep` keeps the backlight powered, so LidDimmer polls the
  clamshell state (1 s) and sets the built-in display's brightness to 0
  on close, restoring the saved value on open (persisted in defaults so
  a crash while dimmed is undone at next launch). External displays are
  untouched; the Mac keeps running unlocked.
- The module's localized display name has changed several times —
  check L10n for the current one; in new copy convey the meaning
  ("your Mac won't sleep") rather than the module name.

### Monitor

- Polling: while the tab is open — every 2 s; the rest of the time a light
  background tick every 5 s (feeds chart history and the red indicator).
  History is timestamped points, ~31-minute buffer, accumulating since launch.
- Rows: cpu (load+temperature), gpu, memory (like Activity Monitor),
  network ↓↑, disk, battery (charge/temperature), health (health/cycles),
  power (watts), uptime. Colored SF Symbols icons.
- Units follow the system's own conventions (audited against Activity
  Monitor/Finder 2026-07-18): memory and swap in BINARY GB (Activity
  Monitor reports RAM that way — 24 GB of chips reads 24, not 25.8);
  disk in DECIMAL GB (Finder/About This Mac — a 1 TB drive reads ~995,
  the old binary formatter showed a phantom "926"); network speeds in
  DECIMAL units (1 MB/s = 10^6 — same as the torrent rows and converter).
  CPU load = (user+system+nice)/total ticks, the same figure as top's
  user+sys; GPU = IOAccelerator "Device Utilization %".
- Battery health = NominalChargeCapacity / DesignCapacity, capped at 100 —
  the same calibrated figure System Settings shows. The raw
  AppleRawMaxCapacity (fallback only) drifts with temperature/charge and
  showed 95–97% on brand-new machines next to the system's 100%.
- Value highlighting: white/green — normal, yellow — borderline, red —
  problem. Thresholds are configurable for load, disk and battery (battery
  semantics are inverted — below the threshold is worse). °C/°F:
  auto by region, can be set explicitly.
- **TEMPERATURE HAS NO THRESHOLD** (Anton, 2026-07-27), for the same reason
  memory has none: the system's verdict is the honest one. Apple publishes no
  thermal limit, and Apple Silicon sits at 90-100 °C under sustained load by
  design — the old fixed pair (yellow 70, red 90) called a healthy machine
  broken under any real workload, and said nothing about a fanless Mac
  throttling quietly in a warm room. Every temperature on the tab (cpu, gpu,
  ssd, battery) now takes its colour from `ProcessInfo.thermalState` through
  `HopCore.ThermalLevel`: nominal and fair are NORMAL — fair only means the
  fans have picked up — serious is yellow, critical is red, and an unknown
  future state never alarms. The number in degrees is still shown; only the
  verdict changed hands. A caption in monitor settings says so, and the two
  stored keys are swept on reset so an upgraded machine keeps no dead
  defaults. "Calm" mode is the default:
  color only for problems; the full rainbow via the "color accents" toggle.
- CPU/GPU temperatures come from the private IOHIDEventSystemClient via
  dlsym: if Apple breaks the API we show "—" and don't crash. No disk
  SMART (it requires privileged access).
- Charts ("detailed" mode, iStat style — Anton, 2026-07-15): below the
  metric row, a full-width filled area (gradient of the metric's color)
  with NO scale, legend or time labels — the row above already carries
  the current value, the shape shows the trend. The first series is the
  filled primary; secondary series (cpu temperature) are thinner plain
  lines in a shade of the same color. Network is TWO identical stacked
  areas (download/upload, shared scale) with tiny ↓/↑ corner markers.
  The window is clamped to the collected history — right after launch
  the areas otherwise started mid-chart and read as different widths.
  The chart window is a setting: 5/10/30 min or 1 hour, default 5
  (history buffer 61 min); lines are laid out by the points' timestamps.
  In chart mode the rows are larger (12pt). The GPU row carries the same
   two-series card as the CPU (load filled, temperature as the thin line) —
   added 2026-07-29, it was the one metric with a number and no trend — and
   the card is drawn ONLY when this Mac reports a GPU load or a GPU
   temperature: an empty chart is worse than no chart.
- An orange "!" (top-left of the menu bar icon, steady) during a red zone (same
  thresholds that color the values, and for heat the system's own critical
  state; a charging battery doesn't count). OFF by
  default, toggle in monitor settings. It shares the top-left "!" with the
  tracker's 8-hour blink — see "Menu bar icon — corner badges".

### Clipboard

- Copy history: text, links, files, images. Capture ORDER is decided by a pure
  rule in HopCore (`ClipboardRules.classify`): a copied FILE beats image data,
  image data beats bare text. Files win FIRST because Finder ships the file's
  icon/thumbnail preview on the pasteboard next to the file URL — reading the
  file URL first stops a copied file (e.g. a 1024×1024 icon) from landing as a
  "1024 × 1024" image row. A copied file becomes a FILE entry showing the file
  NAME (small `doc` glyph); several files copied at once show `name +N`. The
  paths are stored, not the contents. Clicking a row puts the entry back on the
  clipboard (its position doesn't change); a FILE entry goes back as the file
  URL(s) plus the path text — Finder pastes the file itself, text fields get the
  path (vanished files are skipped). File entries never take part in text dedup.
  Buttons: copy / paste into the last app. Confidential content is not stored:
  Hop first honors macOS `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` (used by password
  managers), then applies `ClipboardSecretDetector` to TEXT before persistence
  so a source app that forgets the concealed marker cannot quietly put a
  recognizable credential into history. The detector is deliberately
  high-confidence rather than generic "random string" guessing: private-key
  blocks, JWTs, explicit Authorization credentials, embedded URL passwords,
  provider-defined token prefixes, and high-entropy values under explicit
  secret/password/token/key labels. Public SSH keys, hashes, UUIDs, ordinary
  URLs, Stripe publishable keys, documentation placeholders and unlabeled opaque
  strings remain normal clipboard entries. Detection is local, returns only a
  boolean and never logs the matched value. A detected secret remains on the
  SYSTEM clipboard — the user's copy still works — but never enters Hop's
  durable history. On upgrade, already-stored high-confidence secret text rows
  are removed from UserDefaults immediately on load. File/image/color entries
  are not content-scanned. Everything Hop does keep lives only on this Mac.
  Pruning a file entry off the history never deletes the file on disk. The entry
  limit is in settings.
- Images: raw clipboard image data (a screenshot copied straight to the
  clipboard via ⌃⇧⌘4, "copy image" in a browser) is stored as a PNG in
  Application Support (per bundle id); the row shows a small thumbnail and
  the dimensions ("1280 × 800"), clicking puts the picture back. Own cap
  of 20 image entries (plus the shared limit) — the files of everything
  pruned are deleted; entries whose file vanished are dropped at launch and
  orphan files are swept. Images over 25 MB are skipped. Image entries
  never take part in text dedup.
- Search: the search field appears when expanded (case-insensitive
  substring filter, clear button; collapsing resets the query).
- Collapsed — a user-chosen number of rows (settings, 1...10, default 3),
  expanded — up to 20, but that is only the HEIGHT of
  the list window: the full history is reachable via internal scrolling in
  both views. The height ceiling is DYNAMIC:
  min(430, screen height − 560), then internal scrolling (invariant #1!).
  A constant ceiling has already broken twice — once when removed and once
  when the module count grew. The proper final fix is clamping the height
  of the WHOLE panel to the screen (see "Planned"). The expand icon is a
  crossfade, no "flight". With ≤5 entries the expander is hidden and its
  state resets.

### Clipboard: an entry as a file (1.7.0)

- OFF by default (`clipboardToFile`). When on, every TEXT row grows one more
  icon, LEFT of copy and paste: it acts on the entry rather than on the
  pasteboard, so it comes first. An image, a copied file or a colour has no
  document in it and shows no icon.
- **The format is a setting** (`clipboardToFileFormat`, default `txt`): txt, md,
  pdf or docx, offered as chips labelled with the extensions themselves — the
  converter's chips do the same, and "pdf" needs no translation. txt and md are
  the text as it stands; pdf and docx are RENDERED through the document module's
  own writers, so a copied markdown snippet comes out formatted instead of
  showing its asterisks, and the pdf carries Hop's typography. An unknown stored
  value falls back to txt rather than refusing to save.
- The file lands on the DESKTOP, named after the text itself:
  `ClipboardDocument.fileName(for:)` takes the first LINE (not the first
  characters — a paragraph should be named after its opening sentence, not
  trail into the second), strips what a file name cannot hold, collapses the
  whitespace, cuts to 40 characters and refuses to start with a dot. Text that
  survives none of that is saved as `clipboard.txt`.
- A name already taken gets Finder's own treatment — ` 2`, ` 3`… — so saving
  the same entry twice never overwrites the first file
  (`uniqueName(_:ext:taken:)`, both in HopCore with tests).
- **A written file says so in the row**: the save icon becomes a green tick for
  four seconds and then comes back. Longer than the copy tick (one second) on
  purpose — copying is confirmed by whatever you paste a moment later, while a
  file written to the Desktop gives no other sign that it exists. A cancelled
  save panel writes nothing and shows no tick.
- `clipboardToFileAsk` swaps the silent Desktop save for the system's save
  panel, the one place where the name can be retyped and the folder chosen in a
  single step. The panel opens on the Desktop with the generated name already
  filled in and the chosen format's type set, so "ask" costs one Return.

### Converter

- Separate window (drag & drop from Finder), width 540, height stretches
  (resizable, min 360), content in a ScrollView, window size is remembered.
  The queue lives in the model: closing the window does NOT lose it; the
  converter row in the panel reopens the window (↗). Dropping onto the
  panel row also adds files and opens the window. Folders are expanded
  (up to 500 files each, hidden files skipped), duplicates are skipped.
- **A package is one item, never a folder** (`HopCore.DropExpansion`, found
  2026-09-13). An app, an `.rtfd`, a bundle-format Pages document is a folder on
  disk, and the walk used to go inside a dropped one — an `.app` arrived as up to
  500 rows of its own plists and binaries — while a package INSIDE a dropped
  folder was not a regular file and vanished without a word. Both now arrive as
  the single item Finder shows, and land in their group (or in "can't convert")
  like any file.
- **The walk runs off the main thread.** A folder of thousands of files used to
  stall the window for as long as the walk took; now the rows appear when it
  ends, and drops made in a row still arrive in the order they were made. Clear
  pressed while a walk is still running drops that walk too: its files do not
  come back into the emptied list when it ends.
- **The drop plate is also a button.** A click on it opens an Open panel —
  files, whole folders, any number of both — handed to the same `addToBatch` a
  drag and ⌘V reach, so folders expand, duplicates drop out and an unsupported
  file lands in its group exactly as a dropped one does. The panel filters
  nothing by type: what the converter accepts is decided in one place. The plate
  is the shared `DropPlate`, so it looks, hovers and answers a click the way the
  archive, recognition and uninstaller plates do.
- Paste feeds the clipboard into the converter exactly like a drop, ingesting
  EVERYTHING it supports at once: every file URL on the pasteboard
  (`readObjects(forClasses: [NSURL.self])` returns all items, so a multi-file
  Finder copy adds them all), or a raw image with no backing file (a screenshot
  copied to the clipboard) written to a temp file first — both routes end at the
  same `addToBatch` path. In the panel, ⌘V / ⌘⇧V ingest ONLY when the converter
  is on the active space and no field is being edited (a focused tracker/to-do
  field or timer-digit entry keeps the keys); otherwise the keys pass through,
  and the clipboard module's own paste is untouched. In the standalone window ⌘V
  works regardless of click-focus — Hop is an accessory app with no Edit menu, so
  there is no Paste key-equivalent to drive SwiftUI's `onPasteCommand`. The
  primary route is a local keyDown monitor installed with the window: it fires
  before `NSApplication`'s key-window routing, so paste does NOT depend on the
  window being `NSApp.keyWindow`. Paste chords are matched by the PHYSICAL V key
  code (kVK_ANSI_V = 9), never by the produced character — `charactersIgnoringModifiers`
  is layout-dependent, so ⌘V on a Russian layout arrives as a Cyrillic character
  and a character check would silently drop the paste. Both the panel and the window use the pure,
  tested `KeyChord.isPasteChord` (⌘ held, ⇧ allowed, ⌃/⌥ absent), so paste is
  keyboard-layout-independent. This matters because the window is often opened
  from a background state (the user copied files in Finder, then triggered Hop),
  and `NSApp.activate` is asynchronous — on macOS 14+ cooperative activation it
  can lag or be denied — so `keyWindow` can be nil at the moment ⌘V is pressed;
  a plain key-equivalent would then reach no window and the paste would be
  silently dropped. The monitor ingests ⌘V only when the converter window is the
  intended target — visible AND (already key, or no window has claimed key yet) —
  so it never steals ⌘V from another window that owns key (the gate is the pure,
  tested `ConverterPaste.shouldIngest`). `ConverterWindow.performKeyEquivalent`
  (which calls `super` first) is retained as a harmless fallback, but the monitor
  is the actual route: it fires first and consumes ⌘V, so nothing double-adds
  (and `addToBatch` dedups by path regardless). The window has ONE editable
  field — the number beside the quality dial — so the monitor asks whether a
  field editor holds first responder before it consumes ⌘V, the same rule the
  panel applies to a focused tracker or to-do field: with the caret in the dial
  the paste is the field's, anywhere else in the window it feeds the queue. The
  question is part of `ConverterPaste.shouldIngest`, so the rule cannot drift
  away from its test. An empty or text-only clipboard is a silent no-op; an unsupported file
  lands in the "unsupported" group, same as a dropped file of that type.
- Groups: images / PDF / video / audio / unsupported. Each file gets:
  a thumbnail (QuickLook), name, its own size "current → ~estimated";
  the circle turns into a green checkmark when done. Finished files
  auto-hide by default (the "auto-clear" setting, ON since 2026-07-15);
  with it off they stay in the list with the checkmark. The group total
  shows only with >1 file.
- Images: input JPEG/PNG/HEIC/TIFF/GIF/RAW; output JPEG/PNG/HEIC + AVIF.
  **WebP is deliberately removed everywhere (Anton's decision 2026-07-13):
  macOS has no system WebP encoder in any version; WebP input still reads.**
  The AVIF chip is shown based on actual system support.
- Scale ×0.25/0.5/0.75/1 (default ×1, scale applies to images only).
  Quality: images and PDF have INDEPENDENT sliders (convQuality /
  convPdfQuality, default 55); the number beside either dial is typed as
  readily as it is dragged — see "Shared components".
- PDF: page recompression (~150 dpi), text stops being selectable.
- Video: MP4/MOV/M4V/AVI/MPG → MP4/MOV. Audio: → M4A. MP3/MKV/WebM output is
  not supported by the system; we don't embed ffmpeg.
- **iWork documents are exported by iWork** (`IWorkExport`, tested; Anton
  2026-08-28). Pages, Numbers and Keynote files form a group of their own:
  `.pages`, `.numbers`, `.key` in; PDF out, or each document's own Office format
  — docx, xlsx, pptx — chosen by one switch, since a mixed batch needs one
  setting to serve three kinds of document. Hop does not read these formats at
  all: they are undocumented protobuf containers whose third-party readers break
  on every major release, formulas first. It sends the application an Apple
  Event to run its own "Export to…", so the result is exactly what doing it by
  hand produces, and there is nothing of ours to go stale.
  - **Nothing is required up front** (Anton, 2026-08-28). A `.pages` file joins
    the queue whether or not Pages is installed; only THAT file fails if it
    turns out not to be, and the rest of the batch carries on. The Automation
    permission is likewise asked for by macOS at the first export — there is
    nothing to grant until something is actually being converted. The row says
    so before the button is pressed.
  - The document is opened, exported and closed WITHOUT saving: a batch must
    never modify what it was handed. Failures are read apart — permission
    refused (-1743), application missing (-600 / -10814), or the document
    itself — because the first two are fixable and say different things.
  - No size forecast: the output is another application's work, so the group
    shows what it weighs now and nothing more.
  - Dev entry point: `Hop --iwork-selftest <file> <out dir> [pdf|office]` runs
    one export through the app's own path.
- **What counts as convertible is asked of the system**, not kept as a list
  (`systemCanRead`, 2026-08-04). MKV, WebM, WMV and FLV all classify as movies
  and AVFoundation cannot open ANY of them; they used to land in the video group
  and fail at convert time with nothing said in advance. WMV and FLV are named
  unsupported on arrival now, in the drop itself. AVI and MPG do open, subject
  to the codec inside them (a modern AVI yes, an old DivX one no). The same
  check covers audio, where WMA is the one that cannot be read.
- **MKV and WebM are repacked rather than refused** (`RemuxRules`, Anton
  2026-08-28). Their container is the whole problem: the picture inside is
  usually h264 or hevc, which MP4 holds perfectly well, so swapping containers
  is a COPY — a second of work, nothing lost, and what comes out is an ordinary
  MP4 the normal pipeline reads. They therefore classify as video, and the
  repack happens first inside `convertVideo`; every setting then applies to the
  result exactly as it would to any mp4. When nothing else was asked for (no
  compression, no reframing, mp4 out) the repacked file IS the answer and is
  moved into place rather than copied through a passthrough export.
  - The copy is done by a downloaded helper — a minimal LGPL ffmpeg built by
    `scripts/build-remuxer.sh` (Matroska in, MP4 out, no encoders, no GPL
    parts), installed through the same `ToolInstaller` mechanism and Ed25519
    gate as the torrent engine and 7-Zip. Hop bundles no third-party binaries.
  - **The button fetches it, not the drop** (the archive module's rule): the
    helper downloads when convert is pressed on a batch that contains one of
    these files, and the batch then starts by itself. Before that, a line under
    the video settings says a small helper will download once; during, it shows
    the percentage; a failed fetch says so rather than failing file by file.
  - The first video and (if present) the first audio track are copied;
    subtitle and data tracks are dropped, since MP4 cannot hold them the way
    Matroska does and re-encoding them is not what a repack is.
  - **What it will not do is re-encode.** A webm carrying the classic vp8 +
    vorbis pair cannot go into MP4 at all, and that file fails rather than
    quietly becoming a re-encode nobody asked for.
  - No forecast and no resolution chip transition are shown for these files
    until they are repacked: both are read from the asset, and until the
    container is swapped there is no asset to read.
- Resolution chips ALWAYS all show; the ones above the source's short side are
  dimmed and unclickable (`SettingChip.enabled`). They used to be hidden, and a
  row that changes shape as its neighbour is clicked reads as a bug — picking
  540p made 1080p and 720p vanish (Anton, 2026-08-04).
- Video settings are four independent rows (Anton, 2026-07-15; the dial added
  2026-08-04): "format: MP4 / MOV" — two chips, and until the user picks one
  the HIGHLIGHTED chip is the container the pending files already have, so an
  mp4 stays an mp4 (`highlightedVideoFormat`). There is no "original" chip: the
  row should read as the answer, not as a setting that stands for one (Anton,
  2026-08-04). A format the system cannot write (avi, mkv) highlights mp4,
  which is what it becomes. Changing the container does nothing for size — "resolution: original / 4K / 1080p / 720p /
  540p", "frame" + "fit" (see the reframing entry below), and "compression" —
  a toggle (HEVC instead of H.264, ON by default) plus, when it is on, a
  1…100 slider (`convVideoQualityLevel`, default 55) saying HOW HARD to squeeze;
  its number is typed as readily as it is dragged, like every other dial.
  The legacy single "quality" value migrates into the pair on first launch
  ("hevc" → original + compress).
- **One label column for every group** (Anton, 2026-08-28): images, PDF, video,
  audio and documents all start their values on the same line, 104pt in, so the
  window reads as one table rather than five. A per-group grid was tried first
  and only lined a group up with itself. The image and PDF quality dial is an
  ordinary labelled row now too — it used to float alone on the far right of its
  card while everything else began at the left.
- **The dial shows the bitrate it means** — "55  ≈ 3.7 Mbps" — computed for the
  first video in the queue at the frame the settings will give it and at that
  file's own frame rate (`projectedBitrateText`). A percentage says nothing
  about what is kept or lost; megabits are the figure every platform states its
  own guidance in, and the one a person can hold a floor under (Anton,
  2026-08-28). Hidden with compression off, where nothing sets a bitrate.
- **The fit row draws what it does** (`FitGlyph`): the CHOSEN FRAME with a
  source-shaped picture inside it — filling it and cut by its edges (crop),
  whole between empty bars (bars), or whole over a filled ground (blur). It
  follows the frame row, so picking 9:16 turns the diagram vertical. Three words
  are three guesses until you see them, and a diagram that ignored the frame
  said even less.
- **An image conversion that asks for nothing is a COPY** (`ImagePassthrough`,
  tested; Anton 2026-08-28): same format, full scale, quality at the top — the
  file itself is the answer, and it is copied rather than re-encoded. Asking a
  JPEG encoder for 100 is not "leave it alone": the original was written at some
  ordinary quality with subsampled colour, and the best-quality write keeps full
  colour and barely quantises, so a grainy photo came back four times heavier
  for a picture nobody can tell apart. The quality row says "original" while
  that is what will happen, and the size forecast follows, since the estimate
  runs the same conversion.
- **"Off" and "the dial at 100" are different things**, so the row says which is
  which: with compression off it reads "original", because the tracks are then
  copied across untouched — no encode at all. At 100 the file IS re-encoded, at
  the top of the dial's bitrate. The switch also keeps its distance from the
  dial: side by side they read as one control.
- **Platform presets** (`VideoPlatform`, Anton 2026-08-28) sit ABOVE those rows
  as a shortcut across three of them: "for: reels / feed / tiktok / shorts /
  youtube". Somebody about to post is thinking about where it goes, not in
  ratios and megabits, and the platforms publish both. A preset writes the same
  settings a person would write by hand — shape, resolution 1080 and the
  compression dial — and stores NOTHING of its own, so changing any of those
  afterwards simply unlights it. The figures are the platforms' own published
  recommendations at 1080p30: 5 Mbps for the two Meta frames (9:16 and 4:5),
  8 Mbps for YouTube, Shorts and TikTok; all five ask for 1080 across the SHORT
  side, and only the shape differs. The dial position comes from
  `VideoBitrate.quality` — the inverse of the bitrate formula — so **the target
  is the file's WEIGHT, not the codec's quality**: the leaner codec is asked for
  the same megabits and spends more of its dial to get there, which buys a
  better picture at the size the platform wanted. A preset always turns
  compression ON: with it off nothing controls the bitrate and the platform's
  number is not what comes out. `fit` is deliberately left alone — crop, bars or
  blur is a taste question the platform has no opinion on. More than one chip
  can light at once and that is the truth rather than a clash: TikTok and Shorts
  ask for the same file. A source smaller than 1080 is never upscaled (the frame
  shrinks instead, per `VideoFrame.layout`), so the preset stays honest on small
  footage even though the 1080p chip in the resolution row is dimmed there.
- **Hop drives the video encode itself** (`encodeVideo`, 2026-08-04). The system
  export presets take no bitrate, and their "highest quality" re-encoded most
  footage back to roughly its original size: the converter looked like it was
  doing nothing, whatever the settings said. An AVAssetReader feeds an
  AVAssetWriter with `AVVideoAverageBitRateKey` set from `VideoBitrate`
  (bits-per-pixel-per-frame interpolated over the dial, squared so the travel
  sits where the eye notices, HEVC at 0.65 of H.264, floor 120 kbps; audio
  re-encoded to 128 kbps AAC). Key frames every 2 s. With compression OFF and no
  reframing to do, the tracks are copied across with `AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough`
  instead — a container change costs a second, not a re-encode.
- The video forecast is arithmetic, not a trial encode: bitrate × duration + 2%
  container overhead, and never more than the original (a re-encode that would
  come out heavier keeps the original size in the forecast). Measured against
  real encodes it lands within 2-12%, the widest gap at the bottom of the dial
  where key frames weigh most. The old path encoded eight seconds and
  extrapolated — slow, and with the old presets it forecast the original size no
  matter where the settings stood.
- Downscaling is hop's own videoComposition targeting the SHORT side,
  aspect ratio and orientation preserved — a vertical 1244×1664 at
  "1080p" becomes 1080×1444. The system resolution presets fit into a
  LANDSCAPE box (807×1080 for that source) and were dropped. Never
  upscales; dimensions are rounded to even for the encoders.
- Estimates are honest: images/PDF — a trial conversion of the first file +
  a curve over reference quality points (interpolation, no recompute on
  every slider move); video — bitrate arithmetic (above); audio — the system
  encoder's forecast. Per-file estimates use the sample's compression ratio.
- All converter sizes use decimal units (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes) — the same
  scale as Finder, so the promised and the delivered numbers match; binary
  MiB read ~5% smaller and made every result look heavier than estimated.
- Each group card carries an honesty note "output size is approximate"
  (convApproxNote) while files are pending; during conversion the card
  shows a whole-batch progress bar, a percentage and "converting… i/n".
- **A video row reads "718p → 404p"**: the source resolution and what the
  current settings will actually produce, worked out through `VideoFrame`. It
  showed only the source before, so picking 540p left "718p" standing over it
  (Anton, 2026-08-04). The two agree — and only the source shows — when nothing
  about the frame changes. The result can differ from the chosen resolution: a
  718p landscape clip asked for a 540-wide reel comes out 404p, because the
  frame shrinks rather than upscale.
- **The bar is weighted by BYTES, not by file count** (Anton, 2026-08-04).
  Counting files made a batch of one jump from nothing to everything, and a
  large file among small ones sat still and then leapt. Each file's share of the
  bar is its size; inside a file, video reports its own fraction from the
  encoder and PDF compression reports one per page. Publication is THROTTLED to
  ten a second: the encoder reports every sample, thirty times a second, and a
  bar told to animate to a new value that often never finished a move — it sat a
  few percent in while the percentage beside it ran to a hundred. The end of
  every file publishes regardless of the throttle, so the bar never stops short,
  and a 0.12 s linear ease covers the gap between publications. The bar itself
  is TWO CAPSULES drawn by hand, not a `ProgressView`: AppKit's own animates to
  its own schedule and, fed several values a second, was a fifth of the way
  along while the percentage beside it read 100. The fill is exactly as long as
  the number says, with NO animation on it: the reports are already ten a second,
  and an animated subtree made the fill lag its own colour, so the percentage
  went green while the bar was still orange. Bar, percentage and label all turn
  green together at 100% — orange is for work in progress.
- A finished batch plays its own sound (`Sounds.converted()`, "Ping"), not the
  timer's alarm: "your time is up" and "your files are ready" are different
  messages. It obeys the single app-sounds switch like every other cue.
- **Where it landed is one click away**: once anything has been converted the
  footer carries a folder button naming the destination folder, which reveals
  the last output IN Finder with the file selected (`activateFileViewerSelecting`).
  It follows wherever the files actually went — Downloads, the source folder or
  a custom one — because it is built from the produced file's own URL rather
  than from the setting.
- Clicking the menu bar star brings already-open auxiliary windows
  (converter/settings/about/torrent add) back to the front together with the
  panel — they sink behind other apps on deactivate and looked "closed".
  The raise PRESERVES their mutual stacking order (it walks the current
  front-to-back order in reverse), so the user's arrangement is not reshuffled
  on every summon (Anton, 2026-07-19). Miniaturized windows stay in the Dock.
- Panel z-order: the panel is a transient popover on an elevated level. It is
  above OTHER apps' windows only while explicitly summoned (status-item click,
  the show-panel hotkey, or the right-click "open" item). App activation alone
  — clicking one of Hop's own real windows, cmd-tab — never shows or raises the
  panel. If the panel is open when the user clicks one of Hop's own windows,
  the panel closes (like any outside click), so it cannot resurface above that
  window on the next activation (Anton, 2026-07-19).
- Results: Downloads / next to the original / custom folder; originals are
  never touched; "-min" names with uniquification.

### Speed test

- networkQuality (Apple servers), live numbers during the run.
- Result in a row: "↓ 834 Mbps · ↑ 112 Mbps · 1,450 RPM" — every value
  carries its OWN unit (a bare number is ambiguous, and download/upload
  can differ: Kbit/s vs Mbit/s), separators use thin spaces and
  the icon↔label gap is 6pt: the module label must never be squeezed into
  an ellipsis in any language. The refresh icon is hidden in snapshots
  (product-page screenshots) so the row doesn't reach the panel edge. RPM
  (responsiveness: round trips per minute under full load,
  <100 is bad for calls, 800+ excellent) is visible right away, not only
  in the tooltip.
- A result older than 30 minutes or from a different network is faded
  (textTertiary 0.45).

### Window manager

- Lays out the active window of the last "regular" app via the
  Accessibility API (our own popup is excluded from the count). 18 zones.
  Layouts APPROVED by Anton 2026-07-13: short — ONE row of 8
  (halves, center, full screen, ⅔ left/right); full — TWO rows of 8
  (first row the same; second: quarters, vertical thirds, center-half).
  Rows must be strictly equal in length — unequal rows misalign.
- Glyphs 26×16, fill inset 1pt (any more and the "half" turns into
  a strip). The "center" fill is smaller than the real zone, otherwise
  it is indistinguishable from "full screen".
- Global zone hotkeys: a toggle in the window-manager section of the "other
  modules" settings tab (moved out of "general" 2026-07-21; ON by default —
  Anton, 2026-07-15), a fixed ⌃⌥ scheme
  covering ALL 18 zones:
  arrows — halves, ↩ — full screen, I/J — top-right and bottom-left quarters,
  G — right third, E — left two-thirds, L — bottom third, and the eight whose
  letters the modules name themselves with on the number row, in the order the
  settings grid draws them: 1 — center, 2 — top-left quarter, 3 — bottom-right
  quarter, 4 — left third, 5 — center third, 6 — right two-thirds,
  7 — center column, 8 — top third. Registered via the shared HotkeyManager
  (id 101+). The settings label reads "resize windows with hotkeys"
  (not the old "zone hotkeys").
- The Accessibility permission is requested on the first action.
  **TCC gotcha:** if the toggle in System Settings is on but actions
  don't work and the prompt keeps repeating — the TCC record went stale
  (old signature/path). Fix: `tccutil reset Accessibility
  com.antonshakirov.minimo`, restart the app, grant again.
- If a window doesn't land in a zone exactly — the app has a minimum
  window size and macOS won't shrink it below that.
- **Frame on the first click:** order size→position→size; during layout
  AXEnhancedUserInterface is disabled for the target app (Raycast/
  VoiceOver enable it, and the frame lands wrong); after setting, the
  frame is re-read and corrected with retries (up to 3) — "click several
  times" must never be needed.

### Tracker

- Time tracker over tasks that can be grouped into PROJECTS (dissolved in 8.14,
  brought back in 1.9.0 — Anton, 2026-08-28 — because the week figures below
  are only worth reading per project). All
  logic lives in HopCore (`TrackerEngine`, persisted to `tracker.json` via
  `TrackerController`); the view is glue. Labels tick off `tracker.heartbeat`
  (1/s while a task is tracking). Active by default — unlike torrents it has no
  engine to download, so it isn't opt-in; hidden or shown like every other
  module by its power button in the "modules & tabs" table. The module title (`trackerLabel`) is "time tracker" — it
  names the feature in settings and in the always-on subheader above the list.
- **Several clocks at once** (Anton, 2026-09-06). Starting a task no longer
  stops the one before it: `TrackerEngine.activeTaskIDs` is every task with an
  open interval, `start(taskID:)` touches nothing else, and `stop(taskID:)`
  closes one clock while `stopActive()` closes them all (the panel's "stop
  tracking" and the agent bridge). A review, a call and a build running in the
  background are three tasks, not a queue. What stayed single is the MENU BAR:
  it shows the clock started last (`activeTaskID`, `activeIntervalStart`), since
  one line cannot carry three. Each row counts its own run, and the 8-hour
  warning reads that task's own interval (`activeIntervalStart(taskID:)`).
- **Two levels, three orders.** `TrackerTask.projectID` is the single source of
  BELONGING — nil for a task at the top level, a project's id for one inside it.
  `TrackerData.rootOrder` says what the top level looks like: project ids and
  project-less task ids, mixed, each exactly once. Every project's `taskOrder`
  says the same for its own tasks. The orders never decide whose a task is; they
  only say where among its siblings it sits. `normalizeStructure` repairs all of
  it on load — a task pointing at a project that is not there comes back to the
  top level, listed ids that are not real are dropped, and anything missing is
  appended in the arrays' own order. Each mutation fires `onChange` once.
- **The period switch** (`TrackerPeriod`, stored in `trackerPeriod`, default
  "total") sits on the subheader line and picks what EVERY figure in the module
  covers: today, this week, or all time. One switch rather than three columns —
  three numbers per row in a 360-point panel is a spreadsheet, not a list. It
  drives the task figures, the project sums, the scrub and the typed edit alike:
  editing while "week" is showing sets the week. A task in the middle of a RUN
  shows the run instead of its period figure (see "A run, and the ✓ that ends
  it") — project sums are unaffected, since a run's time is counted from its
  first second. Every edit lands as a
  correction dated TODAY whatever the period, because today sits inside this
  week and inside all time, so the three stay consistent with each other.
  The week is cut by `Calendar.dateInterval(of: .weekOfYear)` on the engine's
  calendar, whose `firstWeekday` is the user's own setting (the same one the
  reminder weekday row uses); changing that setting recuts the figures live
  (`TrackerController.refreshWeekStart`).
- The disclosure triangle is the house play glyph in SOLID ink under an
  explicit opacity (`Theme.glyphInk` + `compositingGroup`), not a translucent
  colour: that glyph is a fill under a round-join stroke, and with a translucent
  colour their overlap is denser than the edges — which reads as an outline
  drawn around the triangle (Anton, 2026-08-28).
- **Projects on screen:** a DISCLOSURE TRIANGLE folds and unfolds (`isExpanded`,
  stored — a folded project stays folded across restarts), the name is semibold,
  and the trailing figure is the sum of its tasks over the current period. A
  FOLDED project whose task is running carries a small green dot, since its play
  glyph is not on screen. Hovering reveals a "+" (add a task straight into it,
  the same 10pt glyph the footer's own add uses) and the delete ✕. Contents are
  indented 16pt.
- **Renaming lives on the NAME, not on the row** (Anton, 2026-08-28). With the
  whole row taking the tap, the triangle's own click was swallowed by it: folding
  a project started a rename instead. The row keeps only the drag; the name has
  the tap.
- **The add row carries both** — "new task" at the left, "new project" pushed
  out to the RIGHT, onto the column the times line up in (Anton, 2026-08-28).
  Side by side, the project button read as trailing the task one; on the time
  column it reads as belonging to the list.
- **An open task keeps its own row above the card** (Anton, 2026-08-28). The
  card used to REPLACE the row, which left a form with no subject: nothing said
  whose name was being edited, or whose history sat below it. The row stays —
  name, star, play button and figure — and tapping it again closes the card,
  which is how it is dismissed besides its own ✓/✕.
  While the card is open the row MIRRORS THE DRAFT: the name being typed and the
  star being flipped show in the row as they change. Showing the stored values
  there instead made the pair read as two different tasks — the row said one
  name while the field said another. An emptied field falls back to the stored
  name rather than blanking the row.
- **A task's history, under its open card** (Anton, 2026-08-28). Tracking
  already recorded every stretch of time as an interval; the card now SHOWS
  them, newest first, with the task's total above. Each line can be edited
  (tap the row), deleted (hover ✕), and a session that was never tracked can be
  added by hand ("add time").
  - **A line's editor holds both halves of it**: WHEN it started — day, month,
    year, hour and minute, each a small bordered MENU, the three date parts in
    the order this locale writes them (`TrackerMoment.order`, tested) — and HOW
    LONG it ran, in a field showing `0:00:00` as its placeholder rather than
    sitting empty. **A duration is always written and read in full**
    (`DurationField`, tested): `h:mm:ss`, hours uncapped — "11:00" for eleven
    hours flat read as eleven MINUTES just as easily (Anton, 2026-08-28). Parts
    are counted from the right, so a lone number is seconds, and over-large
    parts simply add up (90:00 is an hour and a half) rather than being
    refused. Both halves are filled in before it opens: from the line for
    an edit, from the clock on the wall for a new one, so "add time" says what
    it is logging against.
  - **Each part opens a SHORT scrolling list UNDER the editor**, in the flow —
    not a system menu and not a popover (Anton, 2026-08-28). A menu grows to fit
    its items, so sixty minutes became a column down the whole screen; a popover
    brings macOS's own large corner radius, which sat oddly against the panel's
    4–6pt corners. The list is 132pt tall, scrolls, highlights the current value
    and opens scrolled TO it — a decade of years starts where the year already
    is. One list at a time; the open chip carries the editing outline, picking
    closes it, and so does closing the editor.
  - **The date parts are lists, not typed numbers** (Anton, 2026-08-28). Typing
    left no way back out of a half-entered year, and a bare "08" said nothing
    about which month it was. Months are NAMED in the app's own language
    (`shortStandaloneMonthSymbols`), the day list offers only the days the
    chosen month has, and picking a shorter month or a non-leap year pulls the
    day down with it — pick the 31st in March, switch to February, and the
    choice follows to the 28th instead of quietly meaning something else. Years
    run a decade back and one ahead.
  - **A typed date is always a real one.** A day its month does not have is
    pulled to that month's last — 31 April is the 30th, and 29 February exists
    in 2028 but not in 2026 (`TrackerMoment.clampedDay`).
  - `addSession` starts the session at the given moment (now minus its length
    when none is given, i.e. work that has just finished), so it lands on the
    day it belongs to. Moving a line keeps its length; editing the length keeps
    its start. An adjustment moves to that day's midnight, the only precision a
    correction has.
  - **A session keeps its START and moves its end** when edited. The moment work
    began is a fact; its length is what gets misremembered.
  - **The RUNNING session refuses to be edited** — its end is the clock's to
    write. Deleting it stops the clock, since an open interval with nothing on
    screen is worse than either.
  - **Adjustments are in the list too**, labelled and dated, negative ones with
    a minus. They are what the scrub and the typed total write, and together
    with the sessions they ARE the total — a list that quietly omitted them
    would not add up to the number above it.
  - **The list scrolls, cut THROUGH a line** (Anton, 2026-08-29). A long-lived
    task holds hundreds of sessions, so the block is a window seven lines tall
    plus half of the eighth: `(20 + 2) × 7 + 10 = 164pt` against a line's 16pt
    of content, its 2pt of padding each side and the list's own 2pt gap. Ending
    on a whole line read as the end of the list, and the earlier "+N" beneath it
    was a count rather than a way in. Under eight lines nothing scrolls, and the
    cap is LIFTED while a line is being edited — the editor's own date list is
    taller than the window.
  - **The total is the block's headline**, not another line of it: 13pt semibold
    in primary ink against a 9pt tertiary label, sharing a baseline, with room
    under the pair (Anton, 2026-08-28 — at matching sizes he read the label as a
    button and the figure as a row).
  - **Deleting a line asks first**, the same two-step the rows use: the hover ✕
    swaps the line for a delete/cancel pair, and only that deletes (Anton,
    2026-08-28). The ✕ here is 16pt rather than the row's 22 — a history line is
    shorter than a task row, and the full-size button grew the line the moment
    the pointer arrived. The line is pinned to that height, so nothing under it
    shifts as the pointer crosses the list.
  - The edit field sits FLUSH RIGHT, on the column the durations line up in,
    with the same filled background the row's own total edit uses: floating a
    bare cursor beside a ✓/✕ pair read as two icons and no field at all (Anton,
    2026-08-28).
  - `TrackerInterval` and `TrackerCorrection` therefore carry an `id`. A file
    written before they did gets fresh ones on load (tolerant decode); they are
    stable from the first save after that, which is all editing needs.
- **Deleting a project deletes its tasks and their history** (Anton,
  2026-08-28). The confirm keeps the row's silhouette and puts a list glyph with
  the task count next to the delete/cancel pair — a count of tasks would need a
  plural form in every language and the glyph needs none. Deleting the project of
  the running task stops the clock, the same way deleting that task alone does.
- **Dragging with two levels** (`TrackerDrop`, pure and tested): a drop is a
  parent AND an index now, and the two cannot be decided separately — the same
  pointer height means "last in this project" or "first after it" depending on
  what sits above it. A project only ever lands at the top level and travels
  with its own tasks (they are excluded from the landmarks). **A task dropped ON
  a project's own row goes INSIDE it, at the top** — the only way into a FOLDED
  project, since none of it is on screen to aim between, and the same gesture
  works when it is open, so there is one rule rather than two (Anton,
  2026-08-28); the drop maths is given each row's measured height for it.
  Otherwise a task takes the
  level of the row above the pointer: inside a project when that row is one of
  its tasks or its unfolded header, otherwise at the top level — so a task
  leaves a project by being dropped above it, or below a row that belongs to
  nobody, a folded project included. "Important on top" clamps the index within
  the destination's own siblings, exactly as it did on the flat list.
- **What a 1.3.x file does now:** nothing special. Its projects and nested tasks
  load as what they always were — the flatten migration is gone. A file from the
  flat years has no projects and needs no conversion either. Both decode
  tolerantly: `taskOrder` and `rootOrder` default to empty and are derived, so a
  file written before either key existed is not rejected over it.
- **Single active task:** at most one task is ever tracking. Tapping play on
  task B while A runs stops A first — the engine closes the open interval itself
  (`start(taskID:)`), the UI never juggles two. Deleting the active task stops
  tracking (its open interval is dropped with it). `activeIntervalStart` exposes
  the open interval's start so the view can flag a long run (see 8-hour warning).
- **A run, and the ✓ that ends it** (Anton, 2026-08-29). Pause used to be the
  only way out of a stretch of work, and nothing on screen said what had been
  recorded or when: the row went on showing the period's sum, so it never came
  back to zero and the next play simply continued the same number. Play now
  opens a RUN — `TrackerInterval.committed` is false while an interval belongs
  to one, `currentRun(taskID:)` is what those intervals add up to, and the row
  shows THAT figure, counting from zero, in primary ink.
  - **Pause holds a run; the ✓ ends it.** play → pause → play is ONE run made of
    several intervals. `commitRun(taskID:)` stops the clock if it was this
    task's and files every interval of the run, after which the row goes back to
    the period's figure and the next play counts from zero again.
  - **Committing moves no figure.** A run's time is inside `today`/`week`/`total`
    from its first second — the ✓ decides only WHICH number the row shows, never
    how much time exists. That is why a project's sum is unaffected by whether
    its tasks are mid-run.
  - **A run owns the figure while it is open**: no tap-to-type and no scrub
    (`hasOpenRun` gates both), because typing over the run would silently mean
    the period's sum. Correcting a paused run's stretches is what the card's
    history is for.
  - **The ✓ is always visible while a run is open** (`RunCommitButton`,
    accent-green checkmark in the row's own 22pt button box) — it is also the
    row's only sign that a run IS open. It sits to the RIGHT of the hover ✕, so
    a pointer arriving on the row inserts the ✕ beside it instead of sliding the
    ✓ out from under the cursor.
  - In the card's history, the run's own lines are drawn in primary ink until
    the ✓ files them (`TrackerHistoryEntry.isOpenRun`).
  - `end == nil ⟹ committed == false`, repaired on load: a file written before
    runs existed decodes every interval as filed, and an open one would leave a
    ticking row with no ✓ to close it. A hand-added session (`addSession`) is
    filed on arrival — it is work already finished, never part of a run.
  - The agent bridge's `tracker.stop` stops AND commits: an agent has no ✓ to
    press afterwards, and a run left open would keep the row counting it forever.
- **Menu-bar indication:** while a task is tracking, a dark-green wedge sits in
  the icon's bottom-right corner (see "Menu bar icon — corner badges"), next to
  the engine's green wedge when both run. It is suppressed only when the task's
  own `today` value is spelled out as digits in the title (the opt-in below);
  otherwise it shows whether or not a timer is also running. It lives on the
  FIXED 22×17 icon canvas, so tracking has ZERO effect on the status-item width
  and cannot shift the attached panel (this replaced an earlier in-title glyph
  that widened the button — Anton, 2026-07-20). Tracking is a decoration, so it
  drops out of the plain-template fast path and the icon goes through `compose`.
  An opt-in `show task time in menu bar` setting (`trackerTimeInBar`, OFF —
  on the time tracker's own settings page, NOT the timer's: the two clocks
  are independent and either can hold the bar alone, so a switch placed in the
  timer's section read as belonging to the timer, Anton 2026-08-05; same rule as
  the VPN mark, which lives with the VPN settings)
  additionally shows the active task's ticking `today` value as the bar title;
  when those digits show, the dark-green wedge is dropped (the digits are its
  redundant twin). **When a countdown is running too, the two SHARE the title**
  (`MenuBarCycle`, Anton 2026-08-04): each holds it for 5 seconds and hands over
  through a half-second fade to nothing and back, and while they take turns each
  reading carries a glyph of its own in front of the digits (`timer` /
  `stopwatch` for the engine, `record.circle` for the tracked task) — two numbers
  in one slot are ambiguous without one. A single reading is drawn exactly as
  before, digits only and no glyph. Whose turn it is and how far through a
  handover the label is are both computed from the clock, never stored, so a
  redraw arriving late or twice cannot desynchronise the rotation. The label
  otherwise redraws once a second off the heartbeat, which is too coarse for a
  fade, so a 0.05 s ticker is spun up for the length of one handover and
  invalidated as soon as the digits are legible again. Across a handover the
  title's colour is set explicitly (white or black by the BAR's appearance, at
  the fading opacity); at rest it is left to AppKit, which inverts the title
  itself when the status item is highlighted. `today(taskID:)` stays in the engine for
  this figure and for corrections math; the panel shows whichever period its
  own switch is on. The wedge toggles immediately on start/stop off `tracker.heartbeat`; the
  opt-in bar time ticks 1/s. The wedge never touches the title, so it plays no
  part in the width-freeze — only the `trackerTimeInBar` digits (a deliberate,
  opt-in width change of the same class as the countdown) ever change the title
  width. A task left running past 8h also raises the blinking top-left "!".
- **Flat rows** (no card fills — TorrentView-style): regular weight everywhere;
  the ACTIVE task is emphasized by COLOR only (its total label
  `Theme.textPrimary`). Rows sit FLUSH LEFT — there is no reserved drag-handle
  gutter; the play/stop button is the leading element at the 2pt row inset,
  LEFT-ALIGNED (not centered) in a shared 22pt gutter (`RowCircle.gutter`) so its
  visible edge sits exactly on the row inset line — the same line the
  `time tracker` subheader and the `+ new task` footer text start on — and lines
  up with the to-do checkbox on the same left column when the two modules stack
  on a space. The play/stop circle and the checkbox are ONE control at ONE
  visible diameter (`RowCircle.diameter`, 18pt — between the old transport 22 and
  checkbox ~13), both drawn by the shared `TransportCircle`. Delete xmarks are
  hover-only (`HoverDeleteX`); in the tracker one is inserted IN FLOW right
  before the total time, only while the row is hovered, eating into the row's
  flexible spacer instead of overlaying the time — the row's normal 6pt HStack
  spacing separates it from the time on one side and the spacer on the other, so
  the time never moves, is never covered, and a non-hovered row reserves no
  width at all. Vertical rhythm matches the to-dos list verbatim (VStack
  spacing 3, `.padding(.vertical, 2)`); the 8-hour warning row and the inline
  new-task field carry the same tight padding.
- **Subheader:** a compact `time tracker` sublabel sits above the list at all
  times (mono 10 semibold, `Theme.textTertiary`, lowercase — the settings
  section-header treatment), so the tracker and to-do lists are distinguishable
  at a glance when the two modules stack on one space.
- **Task row:** a play/PAUSE button in the main timer's transport family
  (`TransportCircle`: the house rounded-corner play triangle (`PlayGlyph` — see
  "Play glyph" under shared components; not SF's sharp `play.fill`) filled when
  idle = "start"; `pause.fill`
  bordered when this task is active), the name, then ONE time — the all-time
  TOTAL (mono 11, `TimeFormatting.short`, ticking while active) — and the hover
  xmark. Clicking the xmark switches the row into an IN-ROW delete confirm rather
  than deleting on the spot: the play/stop circle, the name AND the far-right time
  all stay exactly where they are — only the hover ✕ gives way to two labelled
  buttons rendered just left of the (now inert) time. Order is macOS's, as
  everywhere in the app: `cancel` (tertiary) leading, `delete` (destructive
  `Theme.accentRed`, the torrent confirm's token) trailing, 12pt apart. What
  keeps a reflexive repeat click from deleting is a DEAD SLOT the width of the ✕
  that opened the confirm, held at the trailing end (`RowDeleteConfirm(reserve:)`
  — 22pt on a task row, 16 on a history line), so the pointer's own spot answers
  to nothing and both options sit clear of it. The time label is INERT while confirming (no
  tap-to-edit / scrub until the confirm resolves). There is no question line — the
  two labelled buttons are the whole prompt. Escape cancels (`.cancelAction`);
  starting a row drag or closing the panel clears the confirm
  (`clearConfirms`/`onDisappear`); the row height and silhouette are unchanged in
  confirm mode. The today/Σ pair from earlier versions is gone: the row shows the
  total only. The active task's total label uses `Theme.textPrimary`.
- **Editing the total** (only while the task is NOT active — the engine refuses
  otherwise and the UI hides the affordance): the manual edit targets the TOTAL.
  `setTotal(taskID:to:)` appends a correction = target − rawTotal (the UNCLAMPED
  total — mirroring `setToday`'s raw-baseline lesson, so an over-corrected task
  can still reach a positive target in one edit), dated the start of today,
  clamped ≥ 0, refused while active, `onChange` once. Scrub the total label
  (horizontal drag, 8pt = ±1 min, a scrub tick per step) with a live local
  preview committed as ONE correction on gesture end (a no-op drag back to origin
  writes nothing); or click the label to type into an inline field that reads
  `H:MM:SS`, `H:MM` or bare minutes — 1 number = minutes, 2 = `H:MM`, 3 =
  `H:MM:SS`, parsed leniently. `.help` carries the hint. `setToday(taskID:to:)`
  remains for the menu-bar path and is unaffected.
- **Mutator guards (engine invariants):** every id-taking mutator no-ops on an
  UNKNOWN task id rather than recording inconsistent state — `start(taskID:)`
  opens no orphan interval, and `setToday`/`setTotal` return false and add no
  orphan correction. A ZERO-DELTA edit (the total/today already equals the
  target) writes no correction and fires no `onChange`, so re-setting a value —
  including dragging left while already at zero — never leaves an empty record
  or triggers a redundant save.
- **8-hour warning:** when the ACTIVE task's current open interval has been
  running for over 8 hours (`activeIntervalStart` vs now, recomputed off
  `tracker.heartbeat` — no timer of its own, no repeatForever), a warning row
  appears directly under that task: `t(.trackerLongRun)` (en: `still tracking —
  over 8 hours. forgot to stop?`, `Theme.accentYellow`) with a small stop button
  that calls `stopActive()`. The row appears and disappears off the heartbeat. No
  system notification in this pass (a possible follow-up). Normally it sits inline
  under its task; when the task list is capped and scrolls (see 8.21) it is PINNED
  directly below the scrolling list instead, so the "forgot to stop?" alert is
  never scrolled out of view.
- **8-hour overrun banner (panel-wide):** the same 8-hour crossing also raises a
  dismissable banner ABOVE the space tabs, on the same chrome surface as the
  "what's new" banner (`overrunBanner`, `Theme.rowBg` card, rounded, an
  `accentYellow` warning glyph + hairline stroke). Copy `t(.trackerOverrunBanner)`
  ("a task timer has been running for over 8 hours" direction, house lowercase,
  ×18) with ONE button, `t(.trackerOverrunDismiss)` ("ok", ×18), that only
  dismisses — the user navigates to the tracker themselves. The episode logic is
  pure in `HopCore.TrackerOverrun` (`TrackerOverrunTests`): visibility keys off
  the open interval's START; dismissing records that start
  (`trackerOverrunAckStart`, a `timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate` Double persisted
  like other banner dismissals) so the banner stays gone for the rest of that
  continuous run, and stopping then starting again — a NEW start — makes the next
  8-hour crossing a fresh episode the stale ack can't suppress. Recomputed off
  `tracker.heartbeat` (no timer of its own); stopping the task removes it (no
  active start). The in-module long-run warning row above is unchanged and
  independent. The menu-bar alert icon is deliberately NOT part of this — it
  ships with the corner-system redesign.
- **Visible rows (8.21):** a per-module `visible rows` cap
  (`trackerVisibleRows`, the tracker's settings page): an ALWAYS-active number 3…15,
  default 10 (`VisibleRowsField`, a single numeric field — the "all"/unlimited
  option was dropped; a stored 0 from the old "all" default reads as 10 on load,
  no migration). When the TASK count exceeds
  the cap, the task list scrolls inside a fixed height of exactly `cap` rows plus
  their inter-row gaps — `29·cap − 3` (26pt row + 3pt spacing, the last gap
  dropped) (`RowCap.listHeight`, INTEGRAL); the subheader, the pinned 8h warning and the
  `+ new task` add row stay OUTSIDE the scroll. While scrolling, the whole-row
  reorder drag stands down (`including: .subviews`) so the pan scrolls, while the
  horizontal total-scrub and the play/stop taps keep working. Snapshots never
  scroll. Shares `RowCap` + `VisibleRowsField` with the to-do module.
- **Drag to reorder:** grabbing ANYWHERE on a row moves it (see "Dragging with
  two levels" above for where it lands) — the
  reorder gesture lives on the row container (`minimumDistance` 3), not a handle.
  It DISAMBIGUATES BY AXIS against the total label's horizontal scrub: on the
  first move past the threshold, a vertically dominant drag (`|dy| > |dx|`) lifts
  the row, while a horizontally dominant one stands down (latched for the rest of
  the gesture) and falls through to the scrub; the scrub mirrors the test (it
  engages only when `|dx| > |dy|`). The two gestures sample at different
  `minimumDistance`s (reorder 3, scrub 4), so the axis test alone is not enough —
  a drag that lifts the row vertically then curves horizontal could otherwise
  scrub on top of the reorder; the scrub's engage branch therefore also refuses
  once a reorder already owns the drag (`guard dragTask == nil`), which is what
  guarantees the two never fire together. Inner controls
  keep their taps — a tap never crosses `minimumDistance`, so the play/stop
  button, the hover xmark and the ✓/✕ field buttons win by SwiftUI's inner-gesture
  precedence. On macOS a click-drag never fights the panel's wheel/trackpad
  scroll. Drop resolution uses a frame-preference resolver (the 8.2 settings-table
  pattern): every row reports its frame in the `trackerList` coordinate space, and
  the pointer's y counts how many other rows sit above it. The dragged row dims
  and follows the pointer; a 2pt accent line marks the insertion point. One
  `moveRootItem(from:to:)` commits per completed drag.
- **Adding / renaming:** a single `+ new task` footer row swaps into an inline
  TextField (lowercase placeholder = the label), committed on Return (empty =
  cancel), Escape cancels. Double-clicking a name opens the same inline field to
  rename. Every inline field (new/rename/total-edit) shows explicit ✕ (cancel) /
  ✓ (commit) buttons right of it (`FieldCommitButtons`, house hover style, macOS
  order: what the field is for lands trailing) — the mouse equivalent of
  Return/Escape.
- **Empty state:** with the always-on subheader naming the module, an empty list
  shows ONLY the subheader and the `+ new task` add row — no placeholder line.
  Adding the first task or deleting the last never shifts the subheader or the
  add row (both keep their heights); the list simply grows or shrinks by one row.
- **Snapshot rule:** every focused-field state is gated off `Snapshot.active`,
  so `--snapshot` renders never show an editing TextField (yellow artifact).
  The tracker AND to-do LOAD paths are gated on `Snapshot.active` too: a
  snapshot/demo render starts from empty and never reads the real
  `tracker.json`/`todos.json` (belt-and-suspenders over the bundle-less `.cli`
  sandbox), so `--tasks` stages its own deterministic content — three tasks (one
  running), three to-dos (one done) — localized per screenshot locale in
  `Snapshot.demoTasks` (a sanctioned per-locale string site covering all fifteen
  locales — English via the `default` case).

### To-dos

- A flat checklist. Logic lives in HopCore (`TodoList` + `TodosStore`,
  `todos.json`, atomic write, tolerant decode of a missing `items` key);
  `TodosController` mirrors `TrackerController` minus the ticker (a checklist
  has nothing that ticks). Both stores (`TodosStore`, `TrackerStore`) move an
  unusable file aside to `.bak` before the next save can overwrite it — not
  only a file that fails to DECODE (corrupt), but one that EXISTS yet cannot be
  READ (permissions, transient IO, not a regular file); a missing file is the
  normal first-run case and is left alone. A save or backup failure logs ONE
  line (no per-mutation spam). Model API: `add(text:)` trims and
  APPENDS at the bottom (empty = no-op), `toggle(id)` flips `done` IN PLACE
  (completed items keep their position), `delete(id)`, and `move(from:to:)`
  reorders (clamped; `from` out of range is a no-op) — the order persists through
  the store. `TodosController.reorder(dragging:toDisplayInsertion:)` saves like
  every other mutation.
- **Completed items sink to the bottom (8.20):** the list DISPLAYS as active
  items (in stored order) first, then completed items (in stored order) —
  `TodoDisplay.order` (pure HopCore, tested). Completing an item animates it DOWN
  into the completed pile; the STORED order is NOT mutated by toggling, so
  unchecking animates it back to its original slot among the active items for
  free. The sink/return is a finite `withAnimation` on toggle (`.easeInOut` 0.22,
  no repeatForever). Drag reorder is CONSTRAINED to a group: an active item can't
  be dragged below the first completed one and a completed item can't rise above
  the last active one — `TodoDisplay.clampedInsertion` clamps the insertion (the
  indicator line stops at the boundary) and `TodoDisplay.reordered` translates the
  display-order drop back to a MINIMAL stored move so every untouched item keeps
  its stored slot (only the dragged item relocates). Reordering completed items
  among themselves is allowed, clamped within the completed group. All of it —
  order, clamp, minimal-move, the toggle/uncheck slot invariant, and the all-done
  / all-active edges — is covered by `TodoDisplayTests`.
- **Row:** a circle checkbox — the shared `TransportCircle` in muted tokens (an
  empty ring when open, a filled `Theme.textTertiary` disc with a knocked-out
  check when done) — the text (mono 12; done = `Theme.textTertiary` +
  strikethrough), and a hover-only xmark. Clicking the xmark switches the row
  into the SAME in-row delete confirm as the tracker (`RowDeleteConfirm`:
  `cancel` leading, `delete` trailing, ~12pt gap, then the ✕-wide dead slot,
  Escape cancels via
  `.cancelAction`); the checkbox and text stay put and only the ✕ swaps for the
  two buttons, so the row keeps its silhouette and height. Starting a drag,
  opening the add field, or closing the panel clears the confirm
  (`clearConfirms`); a new confirm on another row closes the previous one (single
  `confirmingDelete`). It works for done and active items alike. Rows sit
  FLUSH LEFT (no handle gutter): the checkbox is the leading element at the 2pt
  row inset, LEFT-ALIGNED (not centered) in the 22pt `RowCircle.gutter` — its
  visible edge sits exactly on the row inset line, the same line the `to-dos`
  subheader and the `+ new task` footer text start on — the same control family as
  the tracker's play/stop, so the two line up on the same left column when the
  modules stack on a space. The hover xmark
  (`HoverDeleteX`) is inserted IN FLOW right after the row's flexible spacer,
  only while hovered, same mechanism as the tracker: no reserved width on a
  non-hovered row, and a long already-truncated todo text yields room to the
  xmark on hover instead of running under it. The checklist rhythm (VStack
  spacing 3, `.padding(.vertical, 2)`) is shared verbatim with the tracker — the
  two near-twin modules read identically; the 8-hour warning and inline-edit
  rows adopt the same tight vertical padding.
- **Subheader:** a compact `to-dos` sublabel (`todosLabel`) sits above the list
  at all times, same treatment as the tracker's; an empty list shows ONLY the
  subheader and the `+ new task` add row — no placeholder line — and adding the
  first item or deleting the last never shifts either.
- **Drag to reorder:** grabbing ANYWHERE on a row reorders — the same whole-row,
  container-level gesture as the tracker (`minimumDistance` 3, engaging only on a
  vertically dominant drag) and the same frame-preference resolver (rows report
  their frame in the `todosList` coordinate space; the pointer's y counts the
  other rows above it, in DISPLAY order). The checkbox and hover xmark keep their
  taps by inner-gesture precedence. The dragged row dims and follows the pointer;
  a 2pt accent line marks the (group-clamped) insertion point; one
  `reorder(dragging:toDisplayInsertion:)` commits per completed drag.
- **Visible rows (8.21):** a per-module `visible rows` cap
  (`todosVisibleRows`, the to-do settings page): an ALWAYS-active number 3…15,
  default 10 (`VisibleRowsField`, the clipboard's `NumericField` alone — the
  "all"/unlimited option was dropped; a stored 0 from the old default reads as 10
  on load). When the COMBINED
  displayed list (active + completed scroll together) exceeds the cap, the item
  list scrolls inside a fixed height of exactly `cap` rows plus their gaps —
  `29·cap − 3` (26pt row + 3pt spacing) (`RowCap.listHeight`,
  INTEGRAL — no fractional-height header jump); the subheader and the `+ new task`
  add row stay OUTSIDE the scroll (always visible). Scroll indicators are hidden,
  matching the clipboard. While the list scrolls the whole-row reorder drag stands
  down (`including: .subviews`) so the pan drives the scroll — reorder is for the
  short, fully-visible list. Snapshots never scroll (flat render). `RowCap` +
  `RowCapTests` hold the cap/height math.
- **Adding:** a `+ new task` footer row (placeholder `todosNew`, "new task")
  opens an inline field with the same ✓/✕ buttons and `Snapshot.active` gating as
  the tracker. **Return appends and KEEPS the field open** — cleared and still
  focused, so a list is typed in one run instead of reaching for the mouse
  between two tasks (Vanya, 2026-09-08); ⌘Return does the same, for the
  hands that reach for it. Return on an empty field ends the run and closes it.
  ✓ appends and closes — the mouse says the run is over. Escape/✕ cancel, empty
  = cancel. The tracker's `nameField` behaves identically on its ADD fields
  (`newTask`, `newTaskIn`, `newProject` — `Field.isAdding`); renaming a project
  has nothing to continue, so there Return still commits and closes.
- **Task card (expanded row):** clicking a row expands it into a card and
  collapses whatever was open — ONE card at a time, so the panel cannot grow
  without bound. **The row STAYS above its card in both modules (Anton,
  2026-09-08)** — the to-do list used to swap the row out for the card, which
  took the checkbox, the star and the reminder off the screen exactly while the
  task was being edited; the tracker had always kept its row, and the two now
  behave identically. Tapping the row again folds the card. The card is shaped like a note rather than a form: the task text
  is simply the first line (no caption — a line at the top of a card is its
  title), a hairline separates it from a `description` field below, and BOTH are
  `TextEditor`s rather than `TextField`s — a macOS field treats Return as submit
  no matter what, so the text refused to wrap. Return therefore adds a line, and
  BOTH editors hide their scroll indicators: a `TextEditor` shows a knob of its
  own once the text outgrows the box, and the grey pill floating in the card was
  read as a control nobody had put there (Vanya, 2026-09-08).
- **Leaving the card (2026-09-08):** the card carries a **checkbox at its head** —
  the row's own gutter, empty, so the card's text lands on the list's text
  column. **One left line
  (Anton, 2026-09-08):** the card's inset is 6pt on the leading edge (8 on the
  trailing), so `6 + 22` puts its title, description, bell and `repeat` on the
  SAME column as a collapsed row's text (`22pt gutter + 6pt spacing`); the
  gutter is kept even when there is no checkbox in it (the tracker), or the
  tracker's card would sit 22pt to the left of the row above it. The bell's
  glyph is `.leading` in its own 20pt hit area — centred, it stood 4.5pt right
  of that line while the word `repeat` under it stood on it. The weekday squares
  are NOT columned under the day chip: the `repeat` caption is a word, and its
  width differs from one language to the next. Pressing it
  The former ✓ in the bottom-right is a `chevron.up`
  (`tipCollapse`) that folds the card: a tick sitting next to a task was read as
  "check this off", not as "save" (Vanya, 2026-09-08). The card carries no tick
  of its own at all — the row above it holds the checkbox.
- **Deleting from the card (Anton, 2026-09-08):** a `trash` button sits left of
  the star (`CardDeletion`). To-dos delete on the spot; a tracker task that has
  collected time asks first, swapping the icon row for the shared
  `RowDeleteConfirm` (a task at 00:00 goes without a question). While that
  confirm is up it owns Escape, so the card's own `.cancelAction` stands down.
- **The marks in a row (Anton, 2026-09-08):** the star is a BUTTON that
  UNMARKS — marking one stays the card's job, so a row shows nothing new on
  hover; the card's star writes through to the store at once (`onImportant`)
  rather than waiting for the commit, because the row above the card would
  otherwise show yesterday's answer. So does ARMING or CLEARING the reminder
  (`onReminderArmed`, Anton, 2026-09-08): the row's bell answers whether a
  reminder exists, and the bell in the card is the switch for exactly that.
  The day, the clock and the repeat days stay in the draft and land on the
  commit — the row does not print them, and writing a half-typed hour through
  would arm a reminder for a time nobody meant. A to-do with a reminder shows a
  BELL, and the row no longer prints the time (Anton, 2026-09-08) — the bell
  says everything the digits did: `bell.fill` while the firing is still ahead,
  a hollow `bell` once it has rung (what the struck-through time used to say),
  and blinking `accentYellow` while the firing is unseen, which is what clears
  the menu-bar mark. Star, bell and the note hint share ONE geometry
  (`RowMark`: a 14pt box, a 10pt glyph) and ONE ink (`textSecondary`); the star
  is dropped by `RowMark.starDrop` (0.5pt — one device pixel) because a star's
  optical centre sits above its box's: its two lower points are the longer
  pair. The hover ✕ is inserted AHEAD of the marks (right
  after the flexible spacer) in both modules: inserted after them it ate the
  spacer from the right and slid the star out from under the pointer, so a click
  meant for the star landed on delete.
- **The card has NO cancel (Anton, 2026-09-08).** The ✕ is gone and there is no
  discard path at all: **every** way out writes the draft back — the chevron,
  ⌘Return, Escape, tapping another row, tapping the row's own line again,
  starting a reorder drag, tapping the module's background, and closing the
  panel (`onDisappear`). A card is a note being edited in place, and a button
  that silently threw the text away was the wrong half of the pair to keep; the
  price is that a typo cannot be undone by closing. `TaskCardView` therefore
  takes no `onCancel`, and `commitOpenCard()` is the single exit in both modules.
  **Escape** hangs on a hidden `.cancelAction` button rather than on
  `onExitCommand`, which never fired — the focus lives in a `TextEditor` and
  AppKit's field editor eats the key first, which is why a card could not be
  closed from the keyboard at all. The module's background gesture sits on a
  layer BEHIND the content (a container-level gesture takes the click the
  editors need for the caret), and the card carries a background gesture of its
  own so a tap inside it never reaches the module's.
  Beneath them, the reminder group sits on the LEFT (bell, day chip, time, and
  the weekday row under it, captioned `repeat` in words — a glyph there read as
  one more button) and the favourite star on the RIGHT, next to ✓/✕: between the
  bell and the day chip the star looked like part of the reminder.
  Once a reminder exists it shows its day chip and `HH:MM` fields
  (`NumericField` with `padTo: 2`, so a clock reads `22:00` rather than `22:0`;
  the field carries NO focus offset — the old ~1.5pt compensation for AppKit's
  field-editor lift now IS the jump). The day menu reaches a month out. An earlier cut labelled every line
  (`task`, `note`, `remind`, `important`) and paired the star with a toggle; it
  was rejected as too much furniture for one decision and because plain labels
  next to tappable text were indistinguishable (Anton, 2026-07-28). Opening a
  card closes any pending delete confirm and the add field; starting a reorder
  drag collapses it (its fields own the pointer); closing the panel collapses it.
  In a capped list the card lives INSIDE the scroll — the list keeps its
  `29·cap − 3` height. The tracker gets the same card minus the reminder rows,
  and its double-click-to-rename now opens the card instead of a separate inline
  field: ONE editing route.
- **Comment:** `TodoItem.note` (and `TrackerTask.note`), free text. A collapsed
  row with a non-empty note shows a small `text.alignleft` glyph after the
  spacer — the only hint that there is something inside. Inert: the row itself
  opens the card.
- **Favourites:** `important` on both models. The card's star sets it; the
  collapsed row shows the same star. It is the house `StarGlyph`, not SF's
  needle-sharp `star.fill`, and its rounded outline is baked into ONE path —
  filling and stroking separately made a translucent token pile up along the rim
  and read as a glow. A coloured frame was tried
  first and rejected — it read as a warning rather than "this one matters"
  (Anton, 2026-07-28). Per-module `important tasks on top` settings
  (`todoImportantOnTop` OFF; `trackerImportantOnTop` **ON since 2026-08-28** —
  a star that moved nothing was a mark with no consequence, and everyone who
  used one expected it to lift the task) turn the mark into a
  DISPLAY sort: important actives first, then ordinary actives, then the
  completed pile. In the tracker a star lifts a task WITHIN ITS OWN LIST — the
  top level for a loose task, its own project for one inside — and projects
  never move for it (`TrackerDisplay.order(topLevel:)`). Display-only, exactly like the completed sink — the stored
  order is never mutated, so unmarking returns an item to its slot and switching
  the setting off restores the hand-built order. Drag is clamped to the dragged
  item's group (`TodoDisplay` over three groups, `TrackerDisplay` over two).
- **Reminders (to-dos only):** `remindAt`, `repeatDays` (arbitrary weekdays, 1 =
  Sunday), `snoozedUntil`, `firedAt`, `firedUnseen` — every one decoded
  leniently, so a `todos.json` from before the feature loads untouched. The
  tracker has none: its time already means "how long I worked". All arithmetic is
  pure in `HopCore.RemindSchedule` (`RemindScheduleTests`): the next firing for a
  weekday set, DST gaps via `matchingPolicy: .nextTime`, and `reconcile`, which
  fires a past one-shot EXACTLY once (`firedAt` older than `remindAt` is the
  test) and collapses a week of missed repeats into ONE unseen firing. A firing
  rolls a repeating task forward and UN-TICKS it — a task that repeats is not
  finished because last week's instance was ticked.
- **Firing:** three independent settings, all ON (`todoRemindBanner`,
  `todoRemindSound`, `todoRemindMark`). The banner is a `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`
  with two actions, `snooze` (+10 min) and `done`; ONE pending request per item,
  always for its next firing only, so a weekday repeat costs one slot rather than
  seven and 60 items fit under the system's 64-request ceiling (a drop past the
  cap is logged, never silent). The banner is SILENT (`content.sound = nil`) and
  the alert sound is played by the app's own 15s reconcile tick instead, so sound
  works with banners off and can never double up. The tick, plus a wake observer
  and a recompute on panel open, is what makes a reminder land at all when
  notifications are switched off.
- **After a firing:** the row's time stays visible and STRUCK THROUGH once it is
  in the past (a repeating task never shows one — it has already rolled forward),
  and on the next panel open the row blinks three times (finite, no
  `repeatForever`) before `firedUnseen` clears. So a banner that went unseen
  still leaves a trace in the list.
- **Week start:** the weekday squares run in the user's own week order —
  `firstWeekday` (`auto` follows the system region, or Sunday/Monday explicitly),
  since the US counts a week from Sunday and most of Europe from Monday and
  people move without changing habits.
- Registration is by membership like every module (key `"todos"`, title
  `todosLabel`); it captures the keyboard while its field is focused (same
  `onEditingChanged` path as the tracker) so digits don't leak to the timer.
  Fresh installs pair it with the tracker on the "clock" space; existing
  users get it paired with the tracker on the same space by the canonical
  layout repair described under "Default spaces" below.

- **The checkbox is drawn 2pt SMALLER than the tracker's play/stop** (`RowCircle.checkboxDiameter` 16 against `diameter` 18): a RING reads bigger than a disc of the same size, and at equal diameters it looked like a different control (Anton, 2026-07-28). The ring is a `strokeBorder`, not a `stroke`, for the same reason — a centred stroke straddles the path and grows the circle by its own 1.5pt.

### VPN

- Every VPN macOS knows about — a client's own configuration, a corporate IKEv2
  profile, a WireGuard tunnel — with a switch per row. Read and driven through
  `scutil --nc` (list / start / stop), the same door the system's own menu-bar
  switch uses. NOT `NEVPNManager`: it only sees configurations the calling app
  created itself, and reaching another app's tunnel needs an entitlement that
  comes with a paid developer account.
- **Nothing is added by hand.** The list IS the system's list: install a client
  and its configuration appears, remove it and the row goes. There is no "add"
  button in Hop and there should never be one. A second server shows up as a
  second row only if the vendor's app creates a second CONFIGURATION for it —
  macOS's own `+` can only make L2TP, Cisco IPSec and IKEv2, so it cannot add a
  server to a client that speaks its own protocol.
- **The row** is the app's name, then in brackets whatever the configuration adds
  beyond it — a country, a profile. Repeats of the app's own name are stripped,
  and so are protocol words (`OpenVPN`, `IKEv2`, `WireGuard`…): a protocol tells
  the user nothing they can act on. So `hidemy.name VPN` shows nothing in
  brackets, while a configuration named after its country shows `Client (Germany)`.
  No indicator light in the row — the switch already says on or off.
- **Off stays off.** A configuration with on-demand rules is back within seconds
  of being stopped: the rules reconnect it the moment anything asks for a `.com`,
  which is how they are meant to work and why Hop's switch looked broken (Anton,
  2026-07-30). So switching a row off does two things — `scutil --nc stop`, and,
  only when `scutil --nc show` reports `OnDemandEnabled : TRUE`, it also takes
  the service out of the network set (`networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled …
  off`). A service that is not in the set cannot be started by a rule. Switching
  the row back on puts it in the set first and then starts it, and so does
  opening the vendor's own window: a client that could not connect from its own
  screen would look broken, with Hop as the reason. The list still shows a
  held-off configuration — `scutil` prints it without its `*` and calls it
  `Invalid`, which is read as off rather than as a fault. Configurations without
  on-demand rules are only stopped; nothing is taken out of the set that did not
  need to be.

  It needs no per-vendor support and no per-configuration setting: `OnDemandEnabled`
  is a property of a NetworkExtension CONFIGURATION, not of a client, so the same
  read and the same lever work for every VPN on every Mac — what differs is only
  whether a given configuration has rules at all (Anton asked whether this could be
  unified, 2026-07-30). One switch covers the module: **"keep it off until i switch
  it on"** (`vpnHoldOff`, VPN settings, ON by default). Turned off, Hop only stops
  the tunnel and leaves the network set alone — for someone who WANTS on-demand to
  bring it back, or whose configuration is managed by an employer.
- **The country is NEVER guessed from the server's address** (settled 2026-07-29
  after trying it). The system knows the address and nothing else: no hostname,
  no reverse DNS. Asking the address registry does return a country — but it is
  the country the RANGE IS REGISTERED IN, and on the very first live test it said
  Germany for a server the user had set to the Netherlands. A wrong country
  stated confidently is worse than no country, and the alternatives cost more
  than they are worth: a geolocation service would be the first request Hop ever
  makes to a third party, and an offline database would nearly double a 3.7 MB
  app. Only what the vendor itself names is shown.
- **Menu-bar light:** a dot in the bottom-left corner while any tunnel is
  up — GREEN while traffic is going through it, ORANGE while one is carrying
  nothing (see the next bullet) — beside the torrent arrows when those are there,
  the state worth seeing with the panel closed, the exact mirror of the awake dot
  in the opposite corner. When the torrent arrows share that corner THEY keep it,
  nudged 0.6pt further left, and the dot steps to their right: moving the arrows
  inward instead put them under the star's rays, where they stop reading as
  arrows. The dot stands on the arrows' right edge and overlaps it by 1.6pt: a
  fixed 6.5pt step sat on the star's lower-left ray, and the dot over the arrows
  reads better than the dot over the star (Anton, 2026-09-15). One value (`VPNMark`), not two flags, so "up AND stalled" cannot be
  expressed; in monochrome the stalled one becomes a ring at the same outer size,
  since there is no colour left to carry the difference.
  It can be switched off (`vpnMenuBarMark`, VPN settings,
  ON by default — the label is about the STATUS, not about a green dot, since the
  dot has had two colours since 2026-07-31); the module and the switch go on
  working without it. HIDING the
  module takes the dot with it — the badge is the module's voice in the menu bar,
  and a module that is on no space has nothing to say there (Anton, 2026-07-29).
  Hiding does not touch the setting, so putting the module back on a space brings
  the dot back too.
- **A tunnel that is up and carrying nothing.** `scutil` reports the state of the
  SESSION, not of the traffic: a tunnel whose server has gone quiet stays
  `Connected` while nothing comes back through it — the switch is green and the
  internet is dead (Anton, 2026-07-31). The evidence is the tunnel interface's own
  counters. `scutil --nc status <id>` names the interface
  (`InterfaceName : utun4`, cached while the tunnel stays up since looking it up
  costs a process launch), and `getifaddrs` reads its counters — NOT a command:
  this runs every two seconds for as long as a tunnel is up, and launching a
  process on that cadence to learn two numbers would cost more than the rest of
  the module put together.

  **PACKETS, not bytes.** Measured against `netstat -ibn` on 2026-07-31: the
  packet counters `getifaddrs` reports agree to the unit, while its BYTE counters
  are rounded down to a multiple of 1024 and lag behind. On a quiet but healthy
  tunnel that rounding can swallow a whole exchange, which would read as a tunnel
  bringing nothing back — the one mistake this module must not make. A single
  packet is unambiguous. Do not "improve" this back to bytes.

  The verdict (`TunnelLiveness`, HopCore, pure and fully tested): stalled when
  nothing has come back for **6 seconds** AND at least **3 packets** went out
  during that silence. Both halves are load-bearing. Without the silence a
  connection that drops and returns — how a flaky link behaves all day — would
  have the icon blinking between two colours; without the packet floor a Mac left
  alone at night, where nothing is asking for anything, would read exactly like a
  dead tunnel. So the verdict only ever appears when something wanted an answer
  and did not get one. Deliberately asymmetric: a single returning packet clears
  it on the sample that carries it, while making it takes those 6 seconds. A
  counter that goes BACKWARDS is an interface replaced under the same name (or the
  32-bit value wrapping) and re-baselines instead of accusing.

  Several tunnels can be up at once and ANY stalled one turns the light orange: a
  tunnel is only ever called stalled while something is actively pushing bytes
  into it and getting nothing back, which is broken whichever it is. Which one it
  is, the panel says — that row's switch takes the same orange (`MiniSwitch`
  already takes a tint, so no new element and no new string).

  Known limit, accepted: with no network at all, bytes still pile into the `utun`
  and nothing returns, so a Wi-Fi outage reads as a stalled tunnel for the few
  seconds before the system moves the session out of `Connected` itself. What is
  NOT detected — and cannot be, without asking a third party — is a live tunnel
  whose traffic flows while particular hosts stay unreachable.
- **The watch runs whether or not the panel is open.** It has to: the menu-bar dot
  is the whole point of the light, and until 2026-07-31 polling started on the
  list's `onAppear` and stopped on `onDisappear`, so with the panel closed the dot
  showed whatever was true when it last closed. Counters are sampled every tick
  and cost microseconds. The whole thing idles when nobody can see it — the module
  on no space, or `vpnMenuBarMark` off — which is exactly the pair of conditions
  the icon itself is drawn under.
- **The system says when the network moves; the timer is only the floor**
  (`NetworkChangeWatcher`, `VPNWatchCadence`, Anton 2026-08-30). Until then the
  list was re-read every **30 s** with the panel closed, and that was the whole
  latency of the dot: a tunnel brought up outside Hop — from the vendor's own
  window, or by its on-demand rules — took up to half a minute to turn the dot
  green, and one the system dropped took the same whenever its `utun` stayed
  standing behind it, since the free `getifaddrs` check only ever sees an
  interface leave.

  So the module now watches `SCDynamicStore` — the same subsystem `scutil` reads,
  taken from the other end. The keys are the SERVICE entities (`IPv4`, `IPv6`,
  `PPP`, `IPSec` under `State:`, any service) plus global `State:` IPv4 for the
  default route and global `Setup:` IPv4 for the service order, which is what
  moves when a service leaves the network set — including when Hop moves it.
  Services rather than interfaces, because publishing addresses against the
  service is the one thing true of every configuration whatever the vendor built
  it on, and because it is the only signal that survives a `utun` outliving its
  session. Read-only and unentitled: it asks the user for nothing. It is also
  cheaper than the poll it replaces, since a quiet network wakes nobody.

  A signal does not mean the tunnel has arrived — the route change is published
  first and the session then walks `Connecting → Connected` over a few seconds —
  so a signal opens an **8 s window at 1 s** during which the list is re-read
  every tick, and a further signal inside it restarts the window. Signals arriving
  together (a tunnel moves several keys at once, each its own callback) ride on
  one reading: another within **0.3 s** of the last does not order its own. The
  window is also what covers a client whose own state never lands under a watched
  key, since some neighbouring change reaches us and the window then reads until
  the truth shows up. Outside it, the old cadence stands unchanged: **2 s** with
  the panel open or a tunnel up, **30 s** otherwise, the list re-read every tick
  with the panel open, on a vanished interface, and on the 30 s floor. That floor
  is deliberate — a configuration the system announces under nothing at all
  degrades to the behaviour of 2026-07-31 rather than to no watch. Flipping a
  switch in Hop opens the window itself, without waiting to be told.

  `scutil` is run **off the main thread** from here on. It used to run inline on
  the main actor, which was survivable at one launch per tick and is not once a
  network change can order a reading; a reading in flight blocks another, unless
  it has been in flight 10 s and looks wedged, because a module that has stopped
  reading is worse than two readings at once.
- **The vendor's window on demand:** the app is not running at all while Hop
  drives the connection, so it sits in neither the Dock nor the menu bar.
  Clicking the name launches it, and Hop quits it again once its last ordinary
  window closes — three quiet ticks and never within two seconds of the window
  appearing, because a window blinks out of the window-server list during its own
  startup and the first cut killed the app right after it opened. The connection
  survives, since the tunnel is held by the system extension rather than the app.
- Opt-in module (key `"vpn"`, title `vpnLabel`), hidden on a fresh install like
  the eyedropper and recognition: a Mac with no VPN configured would otherwise
  get an empty section it never asked for.

### Apps (launcher)

- Grids of apps kept at hand: NINE across, up to eight rows (72 icons), 32pt
  icons with the name under each. Clicking an icon launches it. The model is
  `HopCore.AppShelf` / `AppShelves` with tests; the store is
  `app-shelves.json` beside the other module files.
- **The ICON is drawn larger than its cell, optically** (Anton, 2026-08-28). An
  app icon is a rounded tile inside a transparent square, so at exactly cell
  size its visible edge stands in from the module's line while every label sits
  on it. The image is drawn ≈9% bigger (capped at 4pt a side) inside a cell of
  the old size, which puts the TILE on the line and leaves the layout — and the
  names under it — untouched. Pulling the whole row out instead was tried first
  and pushed the names past the line the other way.
- **Several grids.** This is the ONE module that exists in copies, so its module
  key carries an id (`apps:<uuid>`) instead of a bare word. A key is matched to
  its shelf by that ID, never as text (`AppShelves.moduleKeys(for:in:)`):
  `moduleKey` writes an uppercase uuid, a key stored lowercase names the same
  shelf, and string equality deleted the shelf while leaving its chip behind as a
  ghost nobody could remove (fixed 2026-07-29). A key whose shelf is gone is an
  ORPHAN (`orphanedModuleKeys(in:)`) and the panel drops it on appear, so a ghost
  left by an older build clears itself. Settings lists the
  grids that exist — each with its name and how many apps it holds, and a ✕ that
  deletes it — plus the `+` that makes another and drops it on the first space.
  Deleting a grid calls `PanelTabsModel.remove(module:)`, which forgets the key
  rather than hiding it: hiding is for a module that still exists, and this one
  is gone.
- **A grid's own name.** Blank by default, in which case the header shows the
  generic `apps` label; typed in the header while editing. The name is also what
  the layout settings show for that grid's chip, so three grids on one space can
  be told apart.
- **The grid's name is typed in a FIELD that looks like one**: a rounded
  `fieldBg` box with a pencil in front of it and a placeholder that asks —
  "type a name", not "name". The first cut was a bare line of text with the noun
  as its placeholder, and it read as a column heading rather than something to
  click into (Anton, 2026-07-30).
- **Icons per row, 3...9, per grid** (`columns`, EIGHT by default — nine fit, but
  nine is the ceiling rather than the starting point, and a row one short of full
  can be widened as easily as narrowed; Anton, 2026-07-30). How many fit
  across and how big they are is the SAME question — the module is as wide as the
  panel either way — so the number is the setting and the size follows from it:
  nine are small, three are enormous (Anton, 2026-07-30). The control lives in
  the grid's EDIT mode, beside the name field and the reordering, because that is
  where everything belonging to this one grid is edited; the ends of the range
  grey out. The gap between icons stays 6.5pt at every width, and a grid holds
  eight rows of whatever its width is (eight across = 64, three across = 24). Narrowing a grid does
  NOT throw away the icons that no longer fit: they stay in the file and come
  back when it is widened again. A grid written before the setting existed loads
  at the default.
- **Names under the icons** can be switched off per grid (`showsLabels`, on by
  default), leaving bare icons for someone who recognises them by sight. The
  switch lives in SETTINGS, one row per grid, not in the module's header: as the
  word "names" it read as a second name field, and as a glyph it was an
  unexplained "Aa" (Anton, 2026-07-29 and 2026-07-30). A settings row has space
  for the whole label — "names under the icons". Both
  fields decode leniently, so a file written before they existed still loads.
  Those rows live in `AppShelvesSettingsView`, which OBSERVES the shelves
  controller: reading `model.appShelves` from the settings screen renders the
  switch but never redraws it, so it looked dead however often it was clicked
  (Anton, 2026-07-30). A nested `ObservableObject` publishes nothing to the
  parent's view — it has to be observed where it is read.
- **Two visible affordances in the header**: `+` picks apps from disk
  (`NSOpenPanel`, restricted to `.application`, starting in Applications), and
  the second button opens edit mode. The first build had adding behind a Finder
  drag and editing behind a 0.6s long press, and Anton found neither
  (2026-07-29) — a mode that cannot be discovered does not exist. Dropping from
  Finder still works and is still documented; anything that is not an `.app` is
  ignored rather than parked as a dead icon.
- **Edit mode** wobbles the icons ±1.8° with a 0.36s half-period, neighbouring
  icons leaning opposite ways. The first attempt (±1.4° at 0.14s) read as
  flicker rather than sway. Driven by a `Timer` that is started on entry and
  invalidated on exit — NOT `repeatForever`, which is banned panel-wide because
  it makes the hosting controller recompute its size forever. Each icon carries a
  ✕ drawn as a muted circle with the glyph knocked out; a bright badge on a
  moving icon reads as blinking.
- **Flush edges AND equal gaps.** A row is eight fixed 30pt slots with `Spacer`s
  between them, not a `LazyVGrid`: the spacers carry all the slack, so the first
  icon sits on the module's left inset, the last on its right one, and the seven
  gaps are identical. Two earlier cuts each failed one half of that — centring
  every grid cell indented the whole row by half the column's slack, and aligning
  only the outer two cells to the edges left the outer gaps 3.6pt wider than the
  inner ones (Anton, 2026-07-29 and 2026-07-30). A half-filled last row keeps the
  pitch with invisible slots, and the drag maths reads the measured pitch instead
  of a guessed cell width.
- **Dragging** reorders the grid: the dragged icon follows the pointer, scaled
  1.08 and above the rest, and a YELLOW LINE marks the GAP it would drop into —
  2pt wide, sitting in the middle of the 6pt column gap. Highlighting the target
  cell instead was the first cut and read as "swap with this one" (Anton,
  2026-07-29). Which gap the line marks follows the direction: dragging forward
  lands the icon AFTER the cell at the drop index (removal shifts the rest back),
  dragging backwards lands it BEFORE that cell. The destination is worked out
  from the travelled distance in cells (36pt across, 44pt down with names, 36pt
  without), so it does not depend on the panel's width, and it clamps rather than
  crashes. The grid only reshuffles on drop.
- **A moved app heals itself**: the path launches it, the bundle id finds it
  again if it moved house, and the shelf quietly rewrites the path.
- **A new grid is empty and says so** — "no apps yet, press + or drag one from
  finder" — rather than showing an unexplained blank strip.
- Opt-in: a fresh install has no grid unless onboarding was asked for one, since
  an empty launcher says nothing. Grids are made in two places, both of which the user reaches while
  arranging modules: the apps section of settings, and under the module/space
  table itself, where the chips are dragged. A grid chip drags between spaces and
  switches off under its power button like any other module. It is also the ONLY
  chip with a
  ✕ — every other module can be switched off but never deleted — and that ✕ asks first,
  with the same scrim + card the tab delete uses, saying that the apps themselves
  are untouched. The ✕ sits LEFT of the power button, in a slot reserved whether
  or not the chip is hovered: the button then holds the same trailing position on
  every chip, deletable or not, and the chip does not resize under the pointer. (It
  used to sit right of it, which pushed a grid chip's control out of line
  with every other chip's — Anton, 2026-09-02.) The apps section of settings
  deletes a grid too.

### Color (eyedropper)

- Opt-in module (key `"color"`, title `colorLabel`): a hotkey or the panel's
  `pick` button opens macOS's own loupe (`NSColorSampler`); the clicked pixel
  becomes a COLOR entry in the clipboard history AND goes onto the pasteboard in
  one step — "press, then paste" is the whole feature. Escape cancels and writes
  nothing. **No Screen Recording permission**: the system loupe returns one
  color, no bitmap of the screen ever reaches Hop (that permission belongs to the
  separate text-recognition module).
- Notation: all three at once. Every row in the list carries `hex`, `rgb` and
  `hsl` in FIXED-WIDTH columns (48 / 92 / 104), and each one is its own copy
  button — a chip that switches a global notation was rejected, because the ask
  is "give me this color as rgb", not "change my mode" (Anton, 2026-07-25).
  Fixed widths mean a short value in one row cannot shift the next row's columns.
  `colorFormat` survives only as the notation written to the pasteboard at pick
  time (default `hex`). The pure conversion (including HSL, hue never rounding to
  360°) lives in `HopCore.ColorFormatting` with tests.
- History: a color IS a clipboard entry — `ClipboardItem.colorHex` holds the
  canonical `RRGGBB` (the row's swatch is drawn from it, so the swatch survives a
  notation change) and `text` holds the pasteable notation. Color entries take no
  part in TEXT dedup, so copying the literal characters "#336699" never swallows
  the color row; re-picking the same color in the same notation changes nothing,
  in another notation it rewrites the top entry in place, and an older entry for
  that color moves up as a fresh pick (`ClipboardRules.remembering(color:text:in:)`,
  tested). A color needs no file on disk, so pruning one deletes nothing.
- Picking CLOSES the panel (a popover would cover the pixel being aimed at) and
  brings it back on the eyedropper's own space once a colour is stored
  (`AppModel.reopenPanel`, wired to the status item's `togglePopover`). A cancel
  reopens nothing: there is no result to look at (Anton, 2026-07-26).
- The module's own mark is a PALETTE, not an eyedropper: the same glyph on both
  ends of the header read as two pick buttons (Anton, 2026-07-25). It is drawn
  small and tertiary like every other module's mark, while the action keeps the
  eyedropper at full weight. The what's-new checklist uses the same palette.
- Module list: the header is one line (name + an icon-only pick action), and
  under it the picked colors as ROWS — swatch plus the three notations. Clicking
  a notation copies exactly it and shows an OPAQUE "copied" badge on the row's
  trailing edge (a translucent one let the numbers show through). Copying goes
  through `putOnPasteboard`, which does NOT re-remember: the list keeps the order
  the colors were picked in and never reshuffles under the cursor. Swatches carry
  a 1px `controlStroke` border — a white swatch would otherwise vanish in the
  light theme.
- Two settings, the same pair the clipboard has: how many colors to keep
  (`maxColorsKey`, 3…100) and how many rows to show before scrolling
  (`colorRowsKey`, 1…10), on the eyedropper's settings page. Colors are pruned by
  their own cap (`ClipboardRules.pruned(…, maxColorItems:)`), so a busy clipboard
  cannot evict them.
- Modules that produce clipboard content enter it through
  `ClipboardController.remember(external:)` / `remember(color:text:)`, which also
  stamp the pasteboard change counter, so Hop's own write never comes back a
  second later as a foreign copy and a duplicate row.
- Hotkey `⌃⌥O` (the "open" action of the `color` module in `ModuleCatalog`). A
  combo is claimed ONLY while its module is switched on (`HotkeyActivation` +
  `refreshModuleHotkeys()`, called at launch and after every layout change):
  taking a global shortcut away from other apps for a module that is off would
  be rude. Its settings row appears on the same condition.
- Ships HIDDEN: it serves designers and developers, so `optInModules` +
  `SettingsKey.optInModulesSeeded` set its hidden flag exactly once; the
  fresh-migrate path hides it deterministically on every recompute and claims
  the flag itself.

### Text recognition (OCR + QR)

- Opt-in module (key `"ocr"`, title `ocrLabel` — "text recognition"; the old
  "screen text" read as a place, not an action). ONE panel line: the name plus
  two icon actions — "select on screen" (`ocrSelect`) and "paste picture". Text
  and barcodes become ONE clipboard-history entry, already on the pasteboard.
  Escape cancels and writes nothing. The panel closes before the crosshair
  appears (a popover would cover what the user is framing).
- **The recognition window steps aside for the crosshair** (Anton, 2026-09-15).
  Whichever button starts a selection, an open recognition window leaves the
  screen at once and comes back where it was, key, as soon as the frame is
  read, with the result, or when the selection is cancelled. It is ordered
  out rather than minimized: the Dock animation would still be on screen when
  the crosshair comes up. Ordering out closes nothing, so the Dock icon stays.
- The action's glyph is `square.dashed` — a marquee, the shape the user drags
  across the screen, in the same dashed family as the Screen Recording
  permission's mark. A bare `viewfinder` read as "enter full screen" and
  `camera.viewfinder` fixed the meaning at the cost of the ink: its camera body
  packed a dark clot into a 12pt glyph (Anton, 2026-07-27). The marquee keeps
  the meaning with an empty middle. It is the SQUARE marquee rather than
  `rectangle.dashed` because the row's icons have to match each other: a
  landscape marquee tall enough to match the boxed arrow beside it ran half
  again as wide, and width is what reads as "bigger". At 12.5 the square one
  draws 11.3 × 12.0 pt — the arrow's own box. Same glyph in the panel row and in
  the window's button.
- **Languages: Vision detects the script itself** (fixed 2026-07-28). The
  request used to name the INTERFACE language plus English and nothing else, so
  anything not written in Latin came back as garbage — the Mori Art Museum's
  opening hours read as `4829 8238(` instead of `森美術館`. Measured on macOS 26
  before choosing the fix: on a six-script image (Japanese, Russian, English,
  Korean, Arabic, Thai) `automaticallyDetectsLanguage` returned ALL SIX in 488 ms,
  while naming those same six languages explicitly LOST the Russian, Arabic and
  Thai lines in 167 ms, and `en-US` alone garbled the Japanese and missed the
  rest. On Latin pages detection matched the explicit list exactly, including the
  mixed Latin/Cyrillic screen an older comment cited as the reason to avoid it.
  So detection is ALWAYS on and there is deliberately NO language setting: an
  earlier cut shipped one and Anton removed it the same day — nobody would find
  it, and naming languages makes recognition worse, not better. Two findings are
  load-bearing and
  must not be re-litigated without new measurements: Vision's CONFIDENCE cannot
  judge a reading (a wrong-language pass over Chinese reported 1.00 while
  producing nonsense), so no scoring or threshold decides anything here; and
  naming many languages HURTS, so the setting must never be described as making
  recognition "more multilingual". `RecognitionPlan` (pure, tested) maps the
  selection onto what the machine supports — a tag Vision does not list makes the
  WHOLE request fail.
- **A second pass repairs a line carrying two distant scripts** (2026-07-28).
  Detection picks ONE model per text region, and a line IS a region, so a line
  holding `Hello 世界` plus two Cyrillic words came back as `Hello 世界 门puBeT
  MMp` — the ideographs right, the Cyrillic noise. Asking for Russian instead
  flips the damage. The fix
  is a rule rather than a better guess: **a pass may only be trusted on the
  scripts it was actually reading** (`HopCore.ScriptMerge`, pure, tested).
  - The TRIGGER is a word that mixes two scripts inside itself — no real word
    does, so it is the signature of a wrong-language reading. Only lines carrying
    such a word are touched, and a picture without one never runs a second pass
    at all (measured: plain Latin and a Japanese page cost exactly what they did
    before; the mixed picture costs ~+75 ms).
  - The SECOND PASS asks for the ALPHABETS on the picture, not "everything the
    first pass missed": the damage always runs one way — a CJK model swallows the
    alphabet beside it, while an alphabetic model merely drops ideographs. Two
    tags at most, since naming many languages makes Vision worse. The reader's
    own script is the last resort, for a page whose alphabet was mangled so badly
    it left no trace to detect.
  - The MERGE takes each word from whichever pass had the competence to read it,
    matching words by the box Vision reports for the substring. Word ORDER always
    comes from the first pass, never from the x coordinate — sorting by x
    reversed an Arabic line.
  - Verified end to end through `Hop --ocr-selftest <image> [--verbose]`, which
    prints the passes and the merge for the reference pictures.
- **A reading that holds a web address can be FOLLOWED** (Anton, 2026-07-27):
  the window shows an "open link" button that hands the address to the default
  browser. This is the point of reading a QR code on the Mac rather than
  pointing a phone at it — a bill's payment link opens in the browser that is
  already signed in. The rule is `ScreenTextRules.link(in:)`:
  - `http` and `https` ONLY. A scanned code is untrusted input, and every other
    scheme is a lever for whoever printed it: `file://` reaches the disk, a
    custom scheme reaches whatever app claimed it. `mailto:`, `tel:`, `WIFI:`
    and vCard payloads stay plain text in the history, with no button.
  - The whole reading is searched, not just barcodes, so an address printed in
    a screenshot opens the same way. An address must spell its scheme out —
    `.md` and `.js` are real top-level domains, so a looser match would offer
    to open `readme.md`. The one exception is a reading that is NOTHING but a
    bare host (`example.com/menu`, the shape of a printed QR code), which is
    promoted to `https://`; a bare host inside a sentence never is.
  - The first address wins, sentence punctuation glued to it is trimmed
    (`see https://example.com.`), and brackets the address opened itself are
    kept (`.../Hop_(tool)`).
  - Where a link is present, open takes the accented button and copy steps back
    to the quiet one. The address is not repeated on the button — it is in the
    text field above, in full, so the destination is read before the click.
- **The result is SHOWN, not filed away silently** (Anton, 2026-07-25): a
  recognition window opens with the text in an editable field, a drop plate for
  images and a copy button. It is a `ConverterWindow` subclass so ⌘V reaches it,
  and the paste monitor stands down while it is key — a picture pasted there is
  input for recognition, not a clipboard entry. The drop plate is generously
  sized (padding 48) and the window sizes to it.
- **The reason this module exists**: the result is a HISTORY entry, searchable
  next to everything else copied. Live Text and the standalone grabbers hand the
  text over once and forget it — without the clipboard link this would be a clone
  with no reason to prefer it (Anton, 2026-07-15).
- Area selection is `/usr/sbin/screencapture -i -x -o -t png` into a temp file,
  NOT a hand-rolled overlay: the system tool brings the real crosshair
  (magnifier, live dimensions, space to reposition) and is the UI users already
  know. A cancelled selection leaves no file, which is exactly how cancel is
  detected; the temp file is deleted right after recognition.
- Recognition: one `VNImageRequestHandler` pass with `VNRecognizeTextRequest`
  (accurate, language correction on) AND `VNDetectBarcodesRequest` — same walk
  over the same pixels, so QR/barcodes cost nothing extra. Runs off the main
  thread. Languages are the app's own plus English, prefix-matched against
  `supportedRecognitionLanguages()` (an unsupported tag fails the whole request);
  automatic detection is deliberately NOT used — it guesses badly on mixed
  Latin/Cyrillic screens, and the UI language is the better hint.
- Assembly is a pure rule in `HopCore.ScreenTextRules` with tests: a barcode WINS
  over text (framing a code is an unambiguous ask; its caption would be noise),
  several codes join deduplicated, otherwise text lines join with **newlines
  kept** — a table or code snippet must not collapse into one run-on line.
  Repeated text lines are never deduplicated (a column really can hold the same
  value twice). `readingOrder` sorts observations top-to-bottom then
  left-to-right, quantizing rows to 1/200 of the height so a hair of vertical
  noise cannot interleave one visual line, with the index as the final tiebreak
  (a valid strict ordering for any input).
- Permission: **Screen Recording**, checked with `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`
  BEFORE the crosshair — without it the capture would come back as a black
  rectangle, which reads as a broken feature. Without it the crosshair does not
  come up, and the ask follows "Screen recording is asked for before a module
  that reads the screen opens" (`PermissionRepair.askForTheScreen`). The denied
  line is itself the button (`askByHand`), under "Hop's own row is dropped at
  most once per run". Hop reads only the rectangle the user draws, only when
  asked.
- States (`ScreenTextController.State`): idle → selecting → reading → done(count)
  / empty / denied / failed. A receipt or complaint clears itself after three
  seconds — nothing here is worth a dialog.
- A dropped or pasted picture skips the crosshair entirely and therefore needs
  NO permission at all: recognition runs on the image handed over, not on the
  screen.
- Hotkey `⌃⌥R`, module-gated exactly like the eyedropper's; ships hidden via
  `optInModules`. Snapshot flags: `--ocr`, or `--tools` for both new modules.

### Languages

- English, Russian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian,
  Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Hindi, Indonesian,
  Turkish, Polish, **Serbian, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu** (Anton,
  2026-09-08). The last five are ADDED, not restored: four of them shipped in
  1.x and were dropped in "Ship with ten languages" because the tail was
  drifting behind the strings, and Serbian has never been in the app at all.
  Their tables are written against the CURRENT key set, not the one they left,
  so nothing arrives already behind.
- **Ukrainian is deliberately not among them** (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **The number of languages is written nowhere** (Anton): not in the release
  notes, the README, the site or this spec. The list names them; a count goes
  stale with the next language added and is then simply wrong.
- Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu are right to left, and `isRTL` drives
  `hopLayoutDirection()` — Hop picks its language in-app rather than through the
  system locale, so nothing else can tell SwiftUI which way a window runs.
- **`--l10n-check` is the gate**: every key in every table, the hanging words
  in each of them, the key chords, the invisible characters, the direction each
  right-to-left line opens in, and the substitutions each entry carries,
  checked in `scripts/checks.sh` before anything ships. A language cannot be
  half added.
- The README carries a translation for every app language. The site has its
  own, smaller set of languages and grows on its own schedule.

### Screenshot (capture and mark up)

- Module `"shot"`, title `shotLabel` — "screenshot", guide letter `g`. The panel
  row carries three buttons — area, window, screen — on the SAME line as the
  name and pushed to its end, not stacked underneath it: the card is one row
  tall, like every other module's. The name gives way before the buttons do. The
  panel closes before the frame appears; a popover would land in the picture.
- **Each button carries a glyph beside its word**: a dashed frame, a window, a
  display. Three words of one weight are three words; the silhouettes say which
  is which before the word is read (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **"Repeat area" is NOT in the row.** A ↺ on its own said nothing about what it
  repeated (Anton, 2026-09-08), and spelled out it does not fit the line. It
  stays where it is understood: `r` inside the selection frame, and a hotkey of
  its own in the hotkeys page.
- **The three are bare words, not filled chips** (Anton, 2026-09-08): the panel
  sets its weight with the awake row's figures and the timer's presets, and a
  chip with a background beside them reads as a heavier control than anything
  else in the panel. Same `HoverLabel` they use — the label brightens under the
  pointer and that is the whole affordance. "Start"/"exit" on the drawing row
  follows, and turns to `Theme.editing` while the layer is up.
- Hotkeys: ⌃⌥S takes an area out of the box. Window, screen and repeat ship with
  NO combination — the letters that would read best were already the window
  manager's — and are assigned in the hotkeys page, where they are LISTED under
  the row that opens the module, there and on the module's own page
  (2026-09-08): a key the spec said was assigned in the settings had no row to
  assign it in.
- **The selection frame is Hop's own, not `screencapture -i`.** The system tool
  never reports WHICH rectangle was chosen, so "repeat the last area" cannot be
  built on it. It is nonetheless built to READ like the system's: hairlines run
  across the whole display through the pointer, so the row and column the drag
  will start on are visible before the first pixel is drawn; the corner it began
  in stays marked while the frame is stretched; a badge beside the pointer shows
  the pointer's own place before the drag and the size in pixels during it, and
  flips at the edges rather than leaving the display. The veil over the rest of
  the screen is light (0.24) — at the 0.62 it started at, the very screen being
  framed could not be read (Anton, 2026-09-08). The frame is a white hairline
  over a dark one, so it survives a white window underneath. Three keys: space
  takes the window under the pointer, `r` the last rectangle, escape cancels.
  The pointer is followed through a tracking area rather than a gesture: SwiftUI
  reports a moving mouse only once a button is down, and the crosshair has to be
  there before that.
- **The frame is ONE white line, drawn on the ring just OUTSIDE the chosen
  pixels.** A second darker rectangle around it gave a visible double edge, and a
  shadow falling inward left the reader unable to say whether the pixel under it
  is in the shot or not (Anton, 2026-09-08). Contrast comes from the veil: dim
  outside, clear inside.
- **The first press draws.** Both overlays host their SwiftUI in a
  `FirstMouseHostingView`, which answers `acceptsFirstMouse` with true: a click
  on a window that is not key is otherwise spent making it key, and the
  selection appeared to work only from the second attempt (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- Capture runs through ScreenCaptureKit in the display's BACKING pixels, so a
  retina shot is saved at full size. Hop's own windows are excluded from the
  filter: the panel never appears in the frame.
- Delay (off, 3, 5, 10 seconds) is a module setting, for a menu that closes on a
  click. The pointer is left out of the picture unless the setting asks for it.
- **The editor opens on every capture, in a window of ITS OWN.** Two shots are
  two windows, either can go to the Dock, and they are marked up side by side
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). The first is centred, the rest cascade down and right from
  it, the way documents do. The window's name is the file's name, kept in step
  with the field in the header.
- **The window is the SHAPE of the shot** plus the header over it, scaled down to
  fit the display and never blown up past its own pixels. It does NOT reopen at
  the size it was left: a window remembering 16:9 for a tall shot is a window
  with dead black space above and below the picture, which is what it had
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). The floor is 1060 × 380 — the tools and the keeping panel
  lying flat are about 930pt wide, and the window leaves air either side of them
  rather than fitting them exactly (Anton, 2026-09-08) — and it is set AFTER the content view
  controller: assigning one resets the window's minimum, which left the toolbar
  hanging out of a window nobody could widen it back from — and a shot smaller
  than that is scaled up inside it instead.
- **"One window with tabs" is a setting** (`shotOneWindow`, off). On, the windows
  are folded together by macOS's OWN tabs — one `tabbingIdentifier`,
  `addTabbedWindow` — rather than a tab bar of Hop's making: the system's brings
  ⌘⇧[ and ⌘⇧], dragging a tab out into a window, and the tab overview for free.
  The title comes back into the title bar while they are tabbed; a tab with no
  name cannot be told from the next one.
- **Closing a shot with marks on it asks first** — unless "copy" or "save" was
  pressed, and unless more was drawn after that: what is on disk is then no
  longer what is on screen, and the question comes back. A shot with nothing
  drawn on it closes without a word.
- **The picture IS the window** (Anton, 2026-09-08): nothing stands beside it and
  no air is left around it — the shot is fitted edge to edge, growing to twice its
  own pixels at most, past which it is only a smear. The toolbar floats OVER the
  picture and is dragged within it; everything else hangs off that toolbar. The
  window resizes and goes full screen. Its SwiftUI root is `minWidth …
  maxWidth: .infinity`, not a minimum on its own: a root that will not stretch
  leaves AppKit and SwiftUI negotiating the size in steps, which is what the
  window going to the Dock and back looked like (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **The editor windows earn Hop its Dock icon**, like the converter and the
  archiver before them (`dockWindows`). A window with no Dock tile disappears
  behind whatever is focused next and has to be hunted for (Anton, 2026-09-08);
  a click on the tile brings back even a minimized one. They leave the list a
  tick after `windowWillClose`, because the delegate reads it from its own
  observer of that same notification.
- **The name is a name, not a box.** Its field carries no fill while nobody is
  typing into it: one appears under the pointer and stays while the name is
  being edited (Anton, 2026-09-08). A filled box round a name at rest is a
  control shouting for attention it does not need.
- **There is no header.** The name of the file, a copy and a save live in a small
  panel of their OWN, beside the tools at the bottom and travelling with them —
  a bar across the top was a black plate with a rule under it, eating the height
  the picture was meant to have (Anton, 2026-09-08). The window keeps an ordinary
  thin title bar, so the traffic lights do not sit on the shot. **The format is
  not asked in the window**: it is one line in the module's settings.
- Tools: crop, pencil, marker, arrow, line, rectangle, oval, numbered steps,
  text, magnifier, blur, eraser; undo ⌘Z and redo ⇧⌘Z. Every tool remembers its
  own colour and width, so the fat yellow marker and the thin red pencil live
  side by side. **One colour for all tools is a setting**, off by default
  (Anton, 2026-09-08): switched on, a colour picked for one tool is picked for
  every tool, and the WIDTH stays each tool's own — for text it is the type
  size, for the marker the width of the nib, and one number cannot be both.
  Switching it on takes the colour in hand with it; switching it off leaves
  every tool with the colour it was drawing in a moment ago rather than
  snapping back to colours chosen long ago. `MarkupInkBook` holds that with
  tests; the surface hears the switch through `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification`,
  so the colours spread while the editor is open. It is one line in the
  screenshot module's settings and covers the drawing layer too — the two share
  one surface. **Fading ink is NOT among them**: ink that disappears is for
  talking over a live screen, and a picture about to be saved has no use for it
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). The export reads `surface.lasting` regardless — marks
  alive by the clock rather than by the tick.
- **A mark already made can be picked up again.** The select tool (`v`, the
  arrow, first in the row) takes the topmost mark under the pointer: a dot
  appears on every point it can be pulled by — the two ends of a line or an
  arrow, the four corners of a box, a blur or the loupe. A scribble and a
  numbered step have no handles and move whole. Delete removes what is in hand
  (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **The corners ARE the sign that a mark is in hand**, so nothing that has
  corners also gets a box round it (Anton, 2026-09-08): the dashed hairline
  over a rectangle was a third outline — the mark's own edge, the hairline and
  the shadow under it — round a shape that already showed where it was. The box
  is left only where there are no handles to show: a scribble, a numbered step,
  a caption. `MarkupEditing.boxed` with tests.
- **Taking another tool ends the edit in progress** (Anton, 2026-09-08): the
  mark in hand is let go, a caption being typed is committed, and the field
  editor gives the keyboard back — backspace over a selected mark was going
  into a text field nobody could see, so nothing was deleted. Only the select
  tool keeps what is in hand. `MarkupSurface.tool` does it on assignment, and
  the canvas self-test checks it.
- **A caption is stored as ONE point, so its box is the words themselves**
  (Anton, 2026-09-08): measured in the font it is drawn in. The bounding box of
  a single point is nothing, and the dashed frame round a selected caption was a
  10pt square sitting off its corner like a badge. **The field is where the
  words will be**: same font, same size, one line high, and shifted two points
  left because a text field insets its own text — a caption used to jump the
  moment it was committed.
- **A mark is picked up by its AREA, not by its outline** (Anton, 2026-09-08):
  anywhere inside a rectangle, an oval, a blur or the loupe, anywhere on a
  numbered step's circle, anywhere across a caption. Lines, arrows and scribbles
  keep proximity — their area IS the line. `MarkupEditing.grabbed` with tests.
- **What a mark is set to is set ON that mark.** Pressing the select tool while
  something is in hand opens ITS settings — the blur's own mode, shape and
  strength, an arrow's head, a caption's size — and colour and width from the
  toolbar go on the mark in hand rather than only on the next one of its kind
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). A blur tuned before it is drawn is a blur tuned blind.
- **A drag is continued while ANYTHING is under the hand**, not only while a
  mark is being drawn: the select tool holds its mark in `editing`, and a canvas
  that watched `drafting` alone started the pick over on every step of the drag,
  so nothing ever moved (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- The edit stands IN for the stored mark while the drag lasts (`editing`), and
  is written back once on release, so pulling a corner across the picture is one
  undo step rather than a hundred. A handle of the mark already in hand wins over
  whatever else is under the pointer, or a corner could never be grabbed from
  inside its own shape. The geometry is a pure function in
  `HopCore.MarkupEditing` with tests: the corner ACROSS from the one being held
  is the one that must not move.
- **A caption already there is EDITED, not written over.** The text tool
  clicked on one opens it in its own field with its words in place; emptied, it
  goes, since a caption with no words is an invisible mark nobody can select
  again (Anton, 2026-09-08). While it is being typed the canvas does not draw
  it — the field does — or it shows twice. Moving and deleting one is the select
  tool's job, as with every other mark.
- **A text mark gets a field of its own** (`.id(shape.id)`). One field carried
  across two marks keeps the words of the first, and the text looks as though it
  moved to wherever the second click landed.
- **The editor draws its marks over a picture the BLUR has already changed.**
  Blur does not sit on the picture, it alters it, and on screen it used to be a
  dashed outline and nothing else — the effect only appeared in the exported
  file (Anton, 2026-09-08). `MarkupRender.effects` builds that backdrop, the
  vector marks go over it, and the export is unchanged.
- **The loupe is PUT DOWN, not drawn out** (Anton, 2026-09-08). Pressing the
  tool drops a lens in the middle of the picture, a third of its shorter side
  across, already selected and with the select tool in hand — so it is dragged
  by its middle, resized by its corners and deleted with backspace the moment it
  appears. Pressing the tool again drops another, and a click on the picture
  drops none: the loupe is never the tool in hand. It is held at the four
  BEARINGS of its circle, dots lying on the glass itself, and grows about its
  own middle — a round thing has no corner to anchor it by, and a dashed box
  round it says nothing (Anton, 2026-09-08). **The drawing layer puts it down
  the same way** (Anton, 2026-09-10): in the middle of the display under the
  pointer, and on that display only. Drawn out by a drag there, it was a second
  loupe that behaved like no other. `ScreenAnnotateController.putLensDown`; the
  canvas self-test puts one on the second monitor.
- **How much it magnifies is set on a DIAL round the lens**: a short arc off its
  lower right, 22° to 74°, a knob on it dragged along the arc for 1.2× to 6×
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). The gentle end was 1.5× and read as too strong for a
  lens meant to point at something rather than blow it up (Anton, 2026-09-08);
  1.2× still magnifies visibly, so the glass never looks like a plain circle.
  Dragged past either end it stays at that end rather than jumping to the
  other. The amount is stored on the mark (`magnification`), so two lenses on
  one picture can magnify differently; a lens saved before the
  dial existed reads as 2×. `MarkupEditing.Zoom` with tests. **The tool is handed over a
  tick later** — `@Published` fires BEFORE the assignment lands, so a tool set
  from inside that sink is overwritten by the one that triggered it, and the
  loupe stayed in hand while every click on the picture drew another lens
  (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **The rim is glass, not a drawn circle**: colourless, thin, and a FIXED width
  in the picture's own points (4, never under 2 on screen) — a lens pulled
  bigger is a bigger lens, not a thicker one (Anton, 2026-09-08). It is stroked
  ON the circle rather than inside it, so the glass sits exactly in its rim and
  the rim eats none of what is under it. Lit from the top left by a gradient
  across it, with a hairline either side to hold its edge. A coloured hairline reads as a
  circle somebody drew (Anton, 2026-09-08). The canvas draws the lens rather
  than the backdrop, so what is under the glass follows the lens as it is moved.
  The export builds the same thing through Core Graphics.
- **The editor watches its SURFACE, not only itself.** `MarkupSurface` is an
  object the editor merely holds, so a tool change or a new mark published
  nothing the view could hear: crop mode never opened and the backdrop never
  refreshed. Two sinks on `$tool` and `$shapes` are what connect them.
- **Crop is a MODE, not a rectangle to draw.** Picking it shows the whole
  picture again with the last cut as a frame — eight handles, a dimmed outside,
  thirds across it — so a crop can be widened back to anything up to the
  original (Anton, 2026-09-08). Each handle's gesture goes on BEFORE
  `.position()`: after it the view fills its parent and the gesture with it, so
  all eight answered for the whole picture and the last one drawn won every
  drag. Their hit area is 2.4× what is drawn — a 13pt dot is not a target. Each
  drag reads the pointer's PLACE in a named coordinate space, not a translation:
  the handle moves as it is dragged, so a translation measured against it drifts
  and shakes, and the edge no longer sat under the mouse (Anton, 2026-09-08). Nothing is applied until it is asked for: while
  the frame is up the keeping panel gives way to the SAME three slots — the size
  the cut will be, then cancel, then ok — so nothing shifts under the pointer
  when the frame goes up (Anton, 2026-09-08). Return keeps the frame, escape
  drops it: a crop that has to be aimed at a button is a crop nobody finishes.
  A drag that misses the frame is swallowed rather than passed to whatever is
  behind, and every SIDE is a target down its whole length rather than a dot at
  its middle. While the frame is up the picture stands 36pt off the window's
  edges, or the handles on its own edge have nowhere to be grabbed from (Anton,
  2026-09-08).
- **The toolbar's drag gesture goes on BEFORE `.position()`.** After it the
  panel fills the whole surface and the gesture with it, so every drag anywhere
  on the picture took the panel for a walk — which is what "the window drags
  instead of the crop" was (Anton, 2026-09-08). The same mistake the crop
  handles had; it is worth checking for wherever `.position` and `.gesture` meet.
  The canvas takes no hits meanwhile, so the crop frame cannot be drawn over.
  Applied, the window SHOWS the cut — the picture is offset inside a clipped box
  rather than re-rendered, so every mark keeps the coordinates it was made in.
- **The keyboard is read by key CODE, not by the letter it prints.** On a
  non-Latin layout the letters a key produces are not the letters the shortcuts
  are named after, and every one of them was dead (Anton, 2026-09-08). The
  physical key does not move.
- **Pressing a tool that is already in hand opens what it can be set to.** Only
  the tools that HAVE settings carry a popover — the arrow's heads, three sizes
  of type, and what the blur does. A popover modifier on every button broke
  clicks through the drawing layer's own panel, where the toolbar lives in a
  window that never becomes key (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **Type is three sizes, not a font panel**, and the blur's own settings —
  inside or around, rectangle, oval or lasso, blur or mosaic, strength and
  dimming — are finally reachable: the model has carried them since the module
  was written and nothing ever showed them.
- **An action that can be taken says so.** Undo, redo and clear are drawn in the
  primary ink while there is something to undo, redo or clear, and in the
  tertiary while there is not (Anton, 2026-09-08). Undo and redo are also
  lifted 2.4 in their box: their arc reaches to y=22 where the rest of the
  family stops at 20, and beside the others they sat visibly low.
- **Both modules can clear the canvas.** The drawing layer always could; the
  editor now has the same button beside undo and redo.
- **The arrow has four heads** — open barbs, a plain triangle, a notched one,
  and one drawn as a hand would. They hang off the arrow TOOL, not off the
  colour: pressing the arrow when it is already in hand opens them, pressing it
  again closes them, and picking one leaves the arrow in hand to go on drawing
  with (Anton, 2026-09-08). They are shown as four drawn arrows rather than four
  words: the choice is about a shape, and they are drawn at the weight an arrow
  actually carries — at a hairline all four looked alike. The head is stored ON
  the mark, so arrows already drawn keep the head they were drawn with; marks
  saved before the field existed decode with none and are drawn notched.
- **The shaft stops where the head begins** — at the notch of a filled head, half
  a line-width short of the tip of an open one. Run to the tip, its round cap
  sticks out past the point and the LINE becomes the tip of the arrow (Anton,
  2026-09-08).
- **Colour and width are two controls, not one.** Width belongs to every tool
  and was buried under a colour swatch, where nobody would look for it (Anton,
  2026-09-08); it has its own button, three lines of rising weight. Its popover
  is a SLIDER as well as four presets: a tool whose width is not one of the four
  showed nothing chosen at all, which reads as no width set. **Colour and width
  are kept per tool and outlive the session** (`markupInks`) — the fat yellow
  marker is not the thin red pencil, and neither should have to be set again
  tomorrow.
- The colour popover carries the eight presets on one row, and on the second the
  colours MIXED BY HAND with the rainbow swatch always last: newest first, seven
  kept, shared by every tool AND by the frame's own ground (Anton, 2026-09-08).
  A colour taken from the presets or from the recents adds nothing — it is
  already there; only a colour mixed in the picker joins the list, so the second
  row is a record of what has actually been used. **Only the colour the panel is
  LEFT on is recorded**: it fires its action on every step of a drag across the
  wheel, so recording each one filled the row with neighbouring shades of the
  single colour actually chosen (Anton, 2026-09-08). It opens `NSColorPanel` in the middle of the screen and in the
  WHEEL mode: left to itself the panel comes back wherever and however it was
  last left — the crayons, or a grey ramp — and the wheel is the one mode with
  hue, saturation and brightness each on a control of its own (Anton,
  2026-09-08). Opened on a near-black colour the whole wheel is drawn black, so
  a dark or washed-out starting colour keeps its hue and has the other two
  opened up. SwiftUI's own `ColorPicker` well is not used — a rectangle among
  round swatches.
- **Copy says it copied**: the glyph becomes a tick for a second. A button that
  answers nothing leaves the user pressing it again. It says so only when it
  did (found 2026-09-10): the tick used to come before the clipboard was even
  written, and a copy that failed showed it all the same. A failed copy says
  "not copied" instead. `MarkupExport.copy` answers whether the clipboard took
  the picture; the export self-test copies into a clipboard of its own.
- **Every field in the app is a `SteadyField`.** AppKit draws a
  placeholder through the CELL and the typed text through the window's field
  editor, and the two disagree by about a point: the text hops the moment the
  field is clicked into (Anton, 2026-09-08). One `NSTextFieldCell` subclass
  hands the same rectangle to `drawingRect`, `edit` and `select`, so the
  placeholder, the caret and the typed text all sit in one place. It also
  carries `focusRingType = .none` — the ring grew the field and the whole panel
  jumped with it. The sweep took every `TextField` in the app (Anton,
  2026-09-08): the to-do draft, both searches, the shelf name, the tracker's
  three, the two numeric fields and the clock. `RateLimitField` used to nudge
  its digits 1.5pt on focus to cancel the hop out; the nudge is gone with the
  hop. The tracker routes focus by an enum, so its fields read that state
  through a `caret(on:)` binding rather than `@FocusState`.
  **A hand-made cell comes back neither editable nor selectable**, whatever the
  field it is put into was, so both are set again after the swap. Without that
  every field in the app was read-only and looked like it simply ignored the
  keyboard (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **⌘Z and ⇧⌘Z work from the keyboard.** Hop is an accessory app with no Edit
  menu, so there is no key equivalent for them to travel on: the surface's own
  key monitor takes them, and only while its window is the KEY one — with
  several editors open, an undo must not reach into the ones behind.
- **The pointer is the NIB for the tools that draw by hand**: a circle for the
  pens, a rounded square for the marker's chisel, drawn at the width the stroke
  will actually be, so its weight is known before a line of it is made (Anton,
  2026-09-08). It is set on every MOVE of the mouse, not on entering: a cursor
  rect belongs to the view the pointer hit, and this view is hit by nothing so
  that it cannot swallow the drawing, so whatever is under it resets the arrow
  the moment it is asked to. **Over a panel it stands down**: the toolbar and the
  blur's own bar say when the pointer is on them, and a nib drawn over a button
  is a nib nobody can press one with (Anton, 2026-09-08). The marker's nib is
  narrow and TALL, upright — the end of the nib seen straight on, a third of the
  stroke's width and its full height (Anton, 2026-09-08). Leaning it and laying
  it flat were both tried first.
- **A hand-drawn stroke is CURVES, not the corners a mouse reports.**
  Catmull-Rom through every point, so the line still goes exactly where it was
  drawn and only stops being a chain of straight bits (Anton, 2026-09-08).
  Points closer than 1.6 apart are not taken at all: a slow hand leaves a
  cluster in one place and the smoothing then fights noise it was handed. Both
  edges of the marker's band are smoothed too, or its outline keeps the corners
  the stroke has lost. `MarkupGeometry.curves(through:)` with tests; the canvas
  and the export draw the same path.
- **The marker is ONE area, filled once.** Translucent ink stroked over itself
  lays a second, darker line along the middle of the stroke (Anton,
  2026-09-08), so the whole sweep is turned into a single filled area first.
- **The marker's nib is SQUARE, and the same in every direction** (Anton,
  2026-09-09). It was a chisel — an upright bar swept along the path, thick
  across the page and thin down it — and the two were joined by a thin spine so
  a vertical stroke drew anything at all. The seam between them ate the middle
  of a horizontal stroke. A highlighter that behaves like the pencil's circle,
  with a rectangle instead of a circle, is what it should have been: the path is
  stroked at the nib's width with a square cap and a round join, and that area
  is filled. The canvas and the export do the same thing.
  The blur's pointer is a crosshair with the tool's own glyph
  beside it — a bare crosshair says "draw something" and no more, and the blur
  is the one region drawn for a purpose of its own.
- **A tool that acts on the PRESS acts once.** The numbered circles and the
  caption used to repeat for every step of a hand merely holding still, because
  the canvas reads a press it has not finished as a press it has not started.
  The rubber is the exception and goes on rubbing while it is held.
- **The POINTER says where a mark will start, and nothing else does.** Guides
  across the picture and a cross at the anchor were both tried and both taken
  out: over a screenshot they are more furniture than help (Anton, 2026-09-08).
  The pointer carries the tool instead — the toolbar's own glyph in white over a
  black outline, its hot spot on the drawing tip, and a crosshair for the tools
  that start at a point. The cursor's view answers no hit test: an overlay that
  does swallows the drag under it, and nothing draws at all.
- **Shift straightens a freehand stroke** too, not only a line: held, the pencil
  and the marker run straight from where they began, on the nearest of eight
  bearings. Let go and the stroke follows the hand again from there. Which corner a rectangle grew from was
  otherwise invisible (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **Option draws from the centre, shift keeps it regular** — a square, a circle,
  a line on one of eight bearings. The rule is a pure function in
  `HopCore.MarkupDrag` with tests: a square is built on the LONGER side, or it
  would shrink away from the pointer.
- **The window does not open on the name field.** It is the only thing in the
  window that takes focus, so it opened with the file name selected and the
  first keystroke would have replaced it (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **A blur comes out of the drag already in hand**, selected and with the select
  tool ready, and a bar of its own appears under it: inside or outside, blur or
  mosaic, rectangle or oval, and how hard (Anton, 2026-09-08). What a mark does
  is set where the mark is looked at, not in a panel across the window, and it
  can be moved, resized and set again as often as needed. The tool's own popover
  keeps the choice for the NEXT blur, the lasso among them — a lasso cannot be
  put down whole.
- **The mask honours the SHAPE.** It used to be a rectangle whatever was chosen,
  so oval and lasso were dead controls: the mask is drawn now, an oval filled as
  an oval and a lasso as its own outline (Anton, 2026-09-08). It is drawn in
  opaque black and white in sRGB — Core Image reads a one-channel grey bitmap as
  an empty picture and lays a black plate over everything.
- **The region is blurred WHILE it is drawn**, moved and resized, settings and
  all — "around" included, which smears everything outside the frame under the
  hand (Anton, 2026-09-08). The backdrop is rebuilt with the mark under the hand
  standing in for its stored self, coalesced to one Core Image pass every 60ms:
  a pass per drag step is a slideshow, and a white film standing in for the blur
  says nothing about what will be hidden. The region carries a hairline and no
  wash; the red dashed box it used to have was a mark of its own and ended up in
  the file.
- **Nothing that shows its own edge gets a box round it**: a lens, an oval and a
  blur are their own outline, so the selection frame is drawn only for the marks
  that have none (Anton, 2026-09-08). The DIAL belongs to the loupe alone — the
  others have nothing to zoom.
- **Any panel over the canvas is added AFTER the drag gesture.** `contentShape`
  hands the whole area to that gesture, so a panel under it is a panel whose
  buttons never get the click: pressing one deselected the mark and took the
  panel down with it (Anton, 2026-09-08). An oval one is
  held at the four points ON the ellipse, and pulling one of them moves that
  edge alone. It starts at strength 5 of 10 — a blur that hides nothing reads as
  a blur that does not work.
- **The strength scale bends.** On a straight one the lightest setting was
  already too heavy to read through and everything past the middle looked the
  same (Anton, 2026-09-08); the radius runs 0.5 to 15 points along a 1.7 power,
  so the foot of the slider is gentle and the head is where the weight is. The
  mosaic's tile follows the same curve, 3 to 34. `MarkupBlur.radius(forStrength:)`
  with tests.
- **The rebuild runs off the main thread**, newest answer only, and Core Image
  keeps ONE context for the life of the app: building a `CIContext` is the
  expensive part of a blur, and a fresh one per drag step is what made the region
  stutter under the hand (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **Blur works in both directions.** "Inside the area" hides what the region
  covers; "around the area" keeps the region sharp and smears the rest, with a
  dimming slider on top of the strength one, because blur alone does not read as
  emphasis. The slider is on the bar under a placed blur as well as in the
  tool's popover, both asking `MarkupBlur.offersDim` (`MarkupBlurTests`): the bar
  once had only the strength, and a blur already on the picture could not be
  darkened (found 2026-09-10). The region is a rectangle, an oval or a freehand lasso, and there
  can be several. "Pixels" is offered beside "blur": a blur over small type can
  sometimes be read back, a mosaic cannot.
- **Every shot opens clean.** The dressing and the mark start at their standard
  values, not at the last shot's: a plain screenshot came up wearing whatever
  the one before it was dressed in (Anton, 2026-09-08). What the mark SAYS is
  the exception — the user's own words and their own image are remembered and
  come back the moment the mark is switched on.
- **Frame dressing** (a toolbar button, off by default): a background from
  twelve presets, a colour of the user's own from the system picker, or a
  PICTURE of their own — copied into Application Support like the watermark's,
  filled to the ground rather than squashed, and blurred by a slider of its own
  so the shot on top of it still reads (Anton, 2026-09-08). Padding, corner
  radius and shadow are sliders; there is an optional browser bar with an
  address the user types. The grounds sit in TWO rows and never a third — six
  presets and the colour of one's own, six presets and the picture — and the
  picture's button is a picture, not another frame (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **The sliders redraw as they move**, coalesced to one render every 50ms.
  Waiting for the slider to be let go meant nothing moved while it was being
  moved (Anton, 2026-09-08); a render per frame at the shot's full resolution is
  what the coalescing is for. Padding is a share of the frame's SHORTER side, so one setting reads
  the same on a wide shot and a narrow one. "Reset to defaults" is one button.
- **Watermark** (the toolbar button beside it, off by default): the user's own
  text or an image, with opacity, size, one of five spots and a "tile it"
  switch. The five spots are hidden while it tiles — a tile covers the whole
  frame and a corner means nothing then — and tiling brings out **how often** it
  repeats: size and count are separate wishes, and a big mark stamped rarely is a
  real one (Anton, 2026-09-08). It can also **lean**, 45° either way, tiled or
  not; a slanted tile starts outside the frame, or the corners it rotates away
  from come out bare. It sits TOP right by default: the bottom of the editor is
  where the toolbar floats, and a mark under it cannot be seen at all. An image chosen here is COPIED into
  `Application Support/Hop/`, so a file moved or deleted later cannot silently
  empty the mark. **Switched on with nothing to say the mark shows nothing**, and
  the size, opacity and place below it have nothing to act on, so it starts with
  `© <the account's full name>` — one keystroke to replace, and the field's
  placeholder is drawn in a colour that can be read (Anton, 2026-09-08).
  Text is stamped in MID GREY, never white: the mark has to hold
  on a dark screenshot and on a white page, and white disappears on the second
  (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **They use the panel's own switch** (`Theme.MiniSwitch`, 30 × 18, the panel's
  green), not a stock `Toggle(.switch)`: next to everything else Hop draws, the
  system switch is half again as tall and a different colour (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- **Neither panel hides its controls behind its own switch.** An `NSPopover`
  keeps the size it was first handed, so a panel that grew when the switch was
  ticked stayed the size of the tick and showed nothing else (Anton,
  2026-09-08). Everything is drawn from the start and dimmed to 0.35 while it is
  off — which also says what the switch is about to turn on. Nothing inside them
  scrolls, for the same reason.
- Both live in the toolbar rather than in a column of their own: a permanent
  panel ate a third of the window for two switches that are off most of the
  time (Anton, 2026-09-08). Their button lights up while the thing it holds is
  on, so an unopened panel still says whether it is doing anything.
- **The mark is stamped on the PICTURE, before the dressing widens the canvas.**
  Stamped afterwards it landed on the background poured around the shot, which
  is not what a watermark is for (Anton, 2026-09-08).
- Export: "save" writes a file into the module's folder — the DESKTOP unless
  a folder was chosen in the settings (Anton, 2026-09-09): that is where ⌘⇧4
  puts a picture and where a hand goes looking for one, and a shot filed into
  a folder of our own has to be explained before it can be found.
  `ScreenshotNaming.folder`. "copy" puts the picture on the clipboard. PNG and JPEG only — macOS
  ships no WebP encoder, so the list must not promise one. Names are
  `shot <date> at <time>.<ext>`, with ` 2`, ` 3`… appended rather than
  overwriting a shot taken in the same minute.
- **A name typed into the editor is cleaned before it becomes a file** (found
  2026-09-10). It went into the path as typed, so `../` climbed out of the
  folder and a leading dot made the file invisible. Slashes and colons become
  dashes, leading dots go, the format's extension is added when missing, and a
  name with nothing left in it gets the dated one. `ScreenshotNaming.cleaned`
  (`ScreenshotNamingTests`); the export self-test saves `../escape` and a blank
  name into a folder of its own, and into a folder that is not there.
- `Hop --canvas-selftest <out.png>` renders the EDITOR's canvas offscreen and
  reads the pixels back: each lens's rim is found in the tool's own colour, and
  the busiest lens has to have changed what it covers. The export path builds
  the same picture by a different route, so a loupe that works in the file says
  nothing about the one under the hand (Anton, 2026-09-08). The canvas is
  rendered with `chrome: false` — the cursor and the typing field are AppKit
  views, and AppKit views come out as a yellow block outside a running window,
  which is how the first run of this test "passed" on nothing at all. It is step
  3 of `scripts/checks.sh`.
- `Hop --live-selftest <dir>` renders the DRAWING LAYER's canvas — no backdrop,
  a made-up frame standing in for the stream — once per blur setting, and reads
  the pixels back: how much there is left to read inside the region under a
  blur, under a mosaic, under the loupe laid over it, outside it in "out" mode,
  beside a region of the other style, with an oval cut instead of a rectangle,
  with no settings on the mark, and with no frame at all — the last two under
  the loupe as well as flat. The no-frame case is read through the ALPHA: the layer is transparent, so a
  region under a black plate and a region left open read the same light, and a
  check on brightness alone could not fail. It is what settled that the loupe
  was magnifying the raw stream past the blur (2026-09-09), and it is step 5 of
  `scripts/checks.sh`, which renders into a directory of its own each run.
- `Hop --markup-selftest <out.png>` runs the whole export path — marks, blur,
  watermark, dressing — over a made-up frame and writes the result. It found the
  browser bar drawn below the picture, an arrow head too thin to read, and the
  watermark sitting on the dressing instead of the shot. It also reads the middle
  of a lens put down on a marker stroke, which has to carry the stroke. It is
  step 4 of `scripts/checks.sh`.

### Draw over the screen

- **Both markup modules sit at the FOOT of the first space** on a clean
  install, with only the window zones under them (Anton, 2026-09-08):
  `ModuleCatalog.defaultModuleOrder`. They are reached for mid-call and
  mid-write rather than read down the panel, and the zones are the one row that
  belongs lower still.
- Module `"annotate"`, title `annotateLabel` — "draw on screen", guide
  letter `i`, ⌃⌥D out of the box. The name and the button are both short on
  purpose: "draw over the screen · start drawing" said the same word twice in a
  row built for one line (Anton, 2026-09-08). A transparent layer on EVERY display, rebuilt
  when displays come and go, each drawing only the marks made on it.
- **The two markup modules share everything they can**: the same surface, the
  same canvas, the same toolbar (Anton, 2026-09-08). So the drawing layer has
  the select tool first in its row, undo and redo beside clear, the nib pointer,
  captions edited where they stand, curves through freehand strokes, the chisel
  marker, colours remembered across both, a tick on copy, and delete for what is
  in hand. Crop is the only tool it does not have: there is no file to cut.
- The arrow that hands the SCREEN back is not the select tool, and no longer
  wears the same glyph: it is a pointer with the way past it open.
- **The mode follows the tool** (Anton, 2026-09-07). Picking any tool means
  drawing over the screen; the arrow at the head of the row is a tool of its
  own — "no tool" — and it hands the screen back while the panel stays where it
  is, so you can scroll, click and show something and then pick a pencil again.
  A separate mode switch was the first attempt and it was one entity too many:
  an arrow beside a pencil says nothing about what pressing it does.
- **The layer opens with a pencil already in hand**, and a setting says
  otherwise (`annotateStartsDrawing`, on out of the box, `annotateDrawMode` —
  "start in drawing mode"). The module is opened to draw, so making the first
  stroke cost a second press was a step for nothing; whoever opens it to point
  at something instead turns the setting off and gets the screen handed through
  from the start. The setting was stored and never read (found 2026-09-10): the
  layer opened drawing either way. `MarkupSettings.startsDrawing`; the live
  self-test reads it with nothing stored and with the setting off.
- **The layer's settings hold the folder and the format too** (Anton,
  2026-09-10). Its save button writes a file like the editor's does, and the
  place to change where that file goes was only on the screenshot module's
  page. Both pages show the same two rows over the same two stored values
  (`MarkupSettings.folderKey`, `MarkupSettings.formatKey`).
- **A caption on the layer keeps its letters** (found 2026-09-10). Bare letters
  pick tools, and the keys were only left alone when a field was typed into in
  the TOOLBAR's window — the caption's field lives in the layer's, so typing
  "hello" switched tools and wrote nothing. Letters go to a field in any of the
  layer's windows. `MarkupKeys.KeyView.aFieldHasTheKeys`; the live self-test
  puts a field in a layer window.
- **A display plugged in or taken away while the layer is up** (found
  2026-09-10). The layer's windows were rebuilt, and nothing else was: the
  backdrop streams still watched the old set of displays, no window was key, the
  Dock came back, and the panel could be left on a monitor that was gone. Now the
  streams follow the new set, drawing takes the keyboard and the Dock again, and
  the panel is brought back within reach.
- **A key for the mode, ⌃⌥P out of the box** (Anton, 2026-09-08).
  `ModuleCatalog.annotatePassAction` — one key, both ways: it hands the screen
  over and takes it back, so windows can be moved and clicked and the drawing
  picked up again without going to the panel. It has to be a global combination
  and not a bare letter like the tools: in the mode that lets clicks through the
  keyboard belongs to whatever is underneath, and a letter would land in its
  fields. P because every module and every window zone had already taken its
  own; it is the ONE non-opening action shipping with a combination, since a key
  pressed while the layer is up is no use if it has to be found in the settings
  first. **It is registered only while the layer is on screen**
  (`HotkeyManager.setDrawingLayerUp`): a key that answers nothing holds no
  combination away from other apps. The mode key follows its module like every
  other, so a switched-off drawing module claims neither.
- While a tool is in hand the layer takes the mouse and a yellow border runs
  around the screen edge — a layer silently eating clicks reads as a frozen Mac.
  With the arrow, the layer stops taking events, the border goes, and the marks
  stay where they are. **There is no tag at the top** (Anton, 2026-09-10): the
  notch cut it in half, and the border together with the panel at the bottom
  already says whose layer it is. The mode key is written in the hint on the
  button that hands the screen back: in the clicks-through mode nothing is left
  on screen but the panel, so that is where the way back has to be written.
- **The drawing layer covers the WHOLE screen, menu bar and Dock included**
  (Anton, 2026-09-08). At `.screenSaver` the layer was drawn over both, but the
  clicks still reached them: a press on the panel where it lay over the Dock
  pressed what was under it too. `CGShieldingWindowLevel()` is the level above
  both, and the panel's own window sits one above that. **The Dock and the menu
  bar are also SENT AWAY while the drawing has the screen** (`.hideDock`,
  `.hideMenuBar`, Anton, 2026-09-08): a level above them stops the clicks but
  not the hover, and Dock icons went on lighting up and naming themselves under
  a pointer that was drawing. They come back the moment the clicks are handed
  through again, and on the way out. Those options hold only while Hop is the
  ACTIVE app, so the layer under the pointer is made key and the app activated
  with it — an app whose windows all refuse to be main is not active, and the
  Dock carried on regardless. The panel is also kept to the working area rather
  than the whole screen, so it does not sit on the Dock in the first place.
- **Escape closes the drawing layer** (Anton, 2026-09-15), the same as ⌃⌥D or
  the close button, marks and all. It is heard while a tool is in hand, when the
  layer holds the keyboard; in the clicks-through mode the keyboard belongs to
  the app underneath and Escape is its. A caption being typed keeps Escape to itself, and Escape pressed in
  another Hop window (settings, the colour picker) does not reach the layer.
  The screenshot editor has no such key: closing it is closing a window.
- **⌘Z, ⇧⌘Z and delete work in the panel over the live screen too** (Anton,
  2026-09-08): they were gated on the window being key, which a non-activating
  panel never is, so the bare letters picked tools while undo did nothing.
- **The floating panel's shadow is the SYSTEM's** (`hasShadow`, Anton,
  2026-09-09). Drawn inside the window it was clipped by the window's own edge,
  and the cut read as a dark rectangle lying under the panel; padding the window
  out only moved the cut further away. AppKit draws it outside the window, where
  nothing cuts it, and a toolbar in its own window asks for none of its own
  (`floating`).
- **A blurred region is filtered on a layer of its OWN.** Filtered inside its
  clip, the blur pulled in the transparency past the region's edge and the
  region came out dark with a gradient into it (2026-09-09): the frame is
  blurred whole on an inner layer, and the clip only decides how much shows.
- **The panel folds into a button** (Anton, 2026-09-09). A screen being
  presented is worth more than a row of tools, so the panel closes into a circle
  carrying Hop's mark, at the place it stood, draggable as before; a click opens
  it again. Drawing carries on with whatever tool was in hand — folding hides
  the tools, it does not put them down. **The circle is dragged like the panel
  it came from**, and one gesture decides which happened: a press that moved is
  a drag, a press that did not is a click that opens it. A Button would have
  taken the press before any drag behind it was seen, and the folded panel
  could not be moved at all (Anton, 2026-09-09). The fold button sits at the LEFT, beside
  the grip: both are about the panel itself rather than about the marks, and its
  glyph is the pair of arrows pulled inward that macOS uses for "smaller" —
  chevrons up and down said nothing about what would happen.
- **The toolbar is a window of its own**, above the layer and always able to
  take a click. It has to be: `ignoresMouseEvents` belongs to a whole window, so
  a panel living inside the layer went unclickable together with it the moment
  the clicks-through mode was switched on — the panel looked switched off with
  no way back (found by Anton on the first run, 2026-09-07). Dragging moves that
  window, and it stays where it is dropped.
- Both mode buttons carry their name as a tooltip: an arrow on its own says
  nothing about what pressing it will do.
- Tools: pencil, fading ink, marker, arrow, line, rectangle, oval, steps, text,
  the loupe, the blur and the eraser. Crop is the one that stays out: there is
  no file here to cut.
- **The loupe and the blur read a LIVE stream of the screen** (Anton,
  2026-09-09). Both work on the pixels beneath them and the layer has none, so
  `LiveScreenBackdrop` streams the display at 15 fps with Hop's own windows
  excluded — the glass would otherwise show itself — and the newest frame is
  what they magnify and smear. The stream is a cost, so it runs only while the
  layer is up AND either tool is in hand or a mark of that kind is already on
  the layer; it stops the moment neither is true, and on the way out. **The
  layer does not open without the screen recording permission** — see "Screen
  recording is asked for before a module that reads the screen opens". Asking
  when the loupe or the blur was picked came too late (Anton, 2026-09-10): the
  ask was a plain `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess`, which shows nothing when the
  list already holds a switched-off row for Hop, so the layer opened, the
  stream never arrived, the loupe and the blur went black and copy and save
  failed — and nothing on screen said why.
- **The first loupe or blur reads a still until the stream comes up** (Anton,
  2026-09-10). The stream starts when the tool is picked and takes about half a
  second to send its first frame, and the first loupe sat black inside its rim
  all that time; a second one did not, the stream being up by then. The layer
  takes ONE still of every display when it opens, when the drawing takes the
  screen back from pass-through, and when a display comes or goes. A loupe or a
  blur reads that still until the display's first streamed frame replaces it.
  A still that lands after the first frame is dropped; a display holds one
  picture at a time; a stream stopped because neither tool is wanted leaves its
  last frame behind as the still; a still taken before the layer closed is never
  read after it. Nothing runs in the background for this: a still is one shot
  per display at those three moments, and the screen recording indicator is not
  held for the whole time the layer is up. Both the still and the stream leave
  out Hop as an APPLICATION rather than a list of its windows: a list is taken
  once, and the layer's own windows are still being ordered in while the still
  is taken. `BackdropPictures` (`BackdropPicturesTests`).
- **EVERY display the layer covers is streamed, and each canvas draws from its
  own** (2026-09-09). A blur or a loupe can go on any monitor, so one stream
  between them cannot work either way round: reading whichever display happened
  to be streamed smeared the FIRST monitor's pixels over a blur on the second,
  and treating the others as having no frame turned them into black plates —
  a whole second monitor black, in "out" mode. A display whose stream has not
  come up yet reads its still, and fails closed only when there is no still
  either.
- **A stream that DIED is asked for again; one that never started is not**
  (2026-09-09). A display unplugged, woken, or a permission taken back reaches
  Hop through the stream's delegate: the last frame is dropped there and then,
  and the display goes back to being one nobody has asked about yet. Held as
  "already asked", a monitor that slept once left the loupe and the blur black
  for the rest of the session. A stream that refused to START is a different
  answer and is not asked again: the canvas fails closed meanwhile, and a retry
  behind every redraw would put a system call under the pointer, which
  `rules/performance-budget.md` forbids.
- **A stream that will not stop says so.** It is the one error on the way out,
  and discarded it leaves a capture running that nothing holds a handle to.
- **The blur over the live screen obeys the bar drawn under it**: "in" and
  "out", blur and dots, the shape, the strength and, around the area, the
  dimming. The bar advertised the first six
  and the canvas read none of them, so "out" — hide everything EXCEPT this —
  did the exact opposite of what was asked, and "dots" drew a blur, which is
  the one thing a mosaic exists not to be. `GraphicsContext` cannot pixellate,
  so the mosaic is cut from the frame by Core Image (`MarkupRender.tiled`) at
  most once per frame per size and handed to the canvas as a picture.
- **A blur with nothing to read fails CLOSED**: no permission, neither a still
  nor a streamed frame yet, or no settings on the mark at all, and the region is covered by a
  solid plate — "out" covers everything but the region. A mark that says it
  hides a name while showing it is worse than one that hides too much. Dots
  asked for with no tiles cut go under the same plate rather than under a blur:
  a gaussian standing in for a mosaic is a promise not kept.
- **The same promise holds where a FILE comes out of it** (2026-09-09). The
  export's blur ran through Core Image and, on any failure, four separate
  fallbacks composited the marks over the UNBLURRED picture: a saved file with
  the account number in the open and a red ring drawn helpfully round it. Every
  one of them now hides more than was asked for rather than less, a region the
  filters could not touch goes under flat black, and an export that cannot hide
  what it was told to hide gives back nothing at all. The last fallback, the
  bare picture handed on when compositing gave up, was found 2026-09-10:
  `MarkupExport.finish`, which the export self-test hands nothing. The editor's preview
  answers to the same rule: until its backdrop is built there is nothing baked
  in yet, so the canvas hides the regions itself instead of showing what is
  under them. It hides them with the editor's OWN picture — the shot as the
  source to smear and the dots cut from it, once per strength — because a
  canvas handed no source can only plate the region, and the preview flashed a
  black box over every new blur until the backdrop caught up (found
  2026-09-10). `ScreenshotEditor.mosaics`.
- **A loupe with nothing to read fails closed too** — black glass in its rim,
  not an empty drag. Drawing nothing at all read as a broken tool.
- **Save and Copy take the display under the pointer, or nothing** (2026-09-09).
  Handed a display the system no longer lists, the capture fell back to whatever
  display came first and wrote a picture of ANOTHER monitor to disk. The
  screenshot capture carried the same fallback (found 2026-09-10) and now fails
  the same way.
- **The loupe magnifies what the blur left, not the frame behind it**
  (measured 2026-09-09). In the editor the backdrop already carries the blur;
  over the live screen the canvas draws it, and glass laid on top used to
  magnify the raw stream straight past it — a name covered on a call came back
  readable under the lens. Every blur region is laid down again inside the
  lens, scaled about its centre by the same zoom.
- **The loupe magnifies the marks laid before it** (found 2026-09-10). A lens
  put down on a marker stroke showed the bare picture inside its rim, as if the
  stroke stopped at the glass. Every mark earlier in the list, an earlier lens
  included, is drawn again inside it, scaled about its centre by the same zoom;
  marks laid after it lie over the glass. The file gets the same by magnifying
  the picture as drawn so far. `MarkupEditing.beneath` (`MarkupEditingTests`);
  the canvas, live and export self-tests read a lens's middle over a marker.
- **Each monitor keeps its own marks** (found 2026-09-10). The layer is one
  surface under a canvas per display, and every canvas drew every mark in its
  own coordinates: a circle drawn on the laptop turned up at the same spot on
  the external monitor, and in a call sharing that monitor. A mark now carries
  the display it was drawn on (`MarkupShape.display`). Each canvas draws, picks,
  erases and reopens captions among its own marks only, and the handles, the
  blur bar and the typing field show on that monitor alone. Undo, redo, clear
  and delete stay one history for the whole layer. Step circles count per
  monitor: Save and Copy take one display, and 3 and 4 without 1 and 2 read as a
  broken count. A mark with no display, as in the editor, belongs everywhere.
  `MarkupScreens` (`MarkupScreensTests`, `StepNumberingTests`); the canvas
  self-test picks a mark from the other monitor, the live self-test draws a
  stroke on the monitor it does not belong to.
- **The drawing layer wears Hop's theme, not the system's** (found 2026-09-10).
  The layer's windows and the panel's window were given no appearance, so they
  took the system's, and so did every popover opened from them: with Hop set to
  light on a dark Mac the sliders of the blur bar, the width and the blur
  settings lost their tracks on a white plate. Both windows are made in Hop's
  theme, like every other window of the app, and an open screenshot editor
  follows a theme change the way the settings window does. The live self-test
  builds both windows and checks what they wear.
- **Fading ink** disappears about two seconds after the pointer lifts, over half
  a second — and the count starts at the LIFT, not at the first point (Anton,
  2026-09-09): a long stroke was half gone by the time it was finished, because
  it carried the stamp it was born with. A stroke still under the hand is drawn
  at full strength, and its stamp is rewritten when the hand comes up. ONE timer serves the whole layer and stops the moment the last
  fading stroke is gone; a layer of ordinary marks keeps no schedule alive.
  A faded stroke leaves the history as well (found 2026-09-10): it stayed in
  it, so undo brought a stroke back from nowhere or spent a press on nothing
  to see. `MarkupDocument.forget` (`MarkupDocumentTests`); the canvas self-test
  fades a stroke and counts what undo has left.
- "Save" and "copy" capture the screen together with the drawing. "Clear"
  empties the layer, the cross closes it.
- **The panel stays on screen while the picture is taken** (Anton, 2026-09-10).
  It used to step out of the shot and come back after it, and for the fraction
  of a second a capture takes it blinked on every copy and save. The shot now
  leaves out every window of Hop's except the drawing layer's — the panel, and
  a note still hanging over a button — so nothing has to move. Only a panel the
  window list does not have steps aside as before: a picture with the panel in
  it is worse than a blink. `MarkupShotWindows` (`MarkupShotWindowsTests`).
- **Closing the layer ends its session** (found 2026-09-10). The cross cleared
  the marks and kept the rest: undo on the next opening brought the last
  session's marks back, and a half-typed caption or a drag in progress came
  along with them. `MarkupSurface.reset`; the canvas self-test resets a surface
  holding a mark and a caption.
- **The layer is NOT excluded from screen capture** — that is the point: the
  marks have to be visible to the other side of a call and in a recording.
- Known limit, said out loud in the docs: the drawing reaches other people only
  when the WHOLE screen is shared. Sharing a single window composites that
  window alone, and Hop's layer is not part of it.

### Ink while a key is held

Show something on screen in a second: hold a chord, circle it, let go, and the
drawing melts away. No panel opens, no yellow border appears and Hop never
comes to the front (Anton, 2026-09-16). It is for a call with a shared screen, a
recording, or a person sitting next to you.

- **The gesture.** While the chord is held, ink can be drawn with the mouse or
  the trackpad on every display, as many strokes as wanted. The pointer is the
  pencil glyph. Releasing any key of the chord hands clicks straight back to the
  apps underneath, and the strokes fade over 0.3 s. There is no delay before
  the layer shows.
- **Default chord: fn + LEFT control** (Anton, 2026-09-16). First it was
  fn + left option; Anton moved it the same evening because fn + control is far
  easier to press. The known cost: fn + control is Wispr Flow's command mode and
  the start of macOS window tiling (fn + control + arrow). Tiling keeps working
  because any other key cancels the gesture and passes through. The right side
  never matches the left: right option and right control are common dictation
  keys.
- **Any other key cancels.** An arrow, a letter or one more modifier while the
  chord is held removes the layer at once, without the fade, and the key press
  reaches the frontmost app as usual. A chord of modifiers is the prefix of many
  other apps' shortcuts, and those must keep working.
- **No activation.** The layer is non-activating panels that never become key:
  keyboard focus, the menu bar and the Dock stay with the app that was in front.
  The first click draws.
- **Settings** live on the "draw on screen" module page, not on the hotkeys
  page: a switch (on by default), the chord with record and reset, colour and
  width. Any chord can be recorded: modifiers alone (fn, control, option, shift,
  command; at least two keys, fn counts) or modifiers with one ordinary key (at
  least one modifier). The side of each modifier is kept as pressed. A keyed
  chord equal to one of Hop's hotkeys is refused with "taken". The colour and
  width choosers are the toolbar's own, with the shared row of mixed colours;
  the ink is its own (`#FF453A`, width 4 by default), apart from the panel's
  pencil. Keys: `annotateHoldOn`, `annotateHoldChord`, `annotateHoldInk`.
- **Not in it:** saving, undo, copying, a tool choice, straight lines, a row on
  the hotkeys page.
- **It ships as 2.1.1 with a card (the card is id 2.1.2: the 2.1.1 build shipped stale, see "Versioning")** (Anton, 2026-09-16). A new gesture is a minor
  change by the versioning rule, but alone it is too small for 2.2. The 2.1.1
  card says it in one line to people already on 2.1; people arriving from an
  older release get the 2.1 lines first (see "Versioning", a fix card that
  catches up). A fresh install learns it from the module's "how it works",
  which ends with the same line.
- **Accessibility.** Without it the gesture does nothing, and the module page
  shows "no access yet" with a grant button under the switch. No system dialog
  opens on its own. Trust is re-read when the Accessibility list changes
  (`com.apple.accessibility.api`), because the alert Hop watches does not move
  on a first grant.
- **The tap is removed, not muted,** while a chord is being recorded, while the
  full drawing layer (control option D) is up and while the keyboard is locked.
  A present tap swallows a keyed chord's key and sits ahead of the keyboard
  lock's own tap. The chord does nothing while the full layer is up.
- **fn** reaches macOS only from Apple keyboards; whoever has no fn records
  another chord. Fn state is read only from a flagsChanged event with key code
  63: arrows carry the fn flag without fn being pressed.
- **Secure Event Input** (password fields) keeps keys away from every tap, so a
  key does not cancel there; releasing the chord still works.
- **Cost.** The tap lives on its own thread with its own run loop, filters only
  keyDown, keyUp and flagsChanged, and decides under a lock without allocating;
  only an effect hops to the main thread. A tap on Hop's main run loop would
  delay typing system-wide whenever the main thread is busy. Idle CPU is about
  0 %, drawing stays under 5 %.
- **Cursor.** The window server ignores a cursor set by an app that is not in
  front, so the layer turns on `SetsCursorInBackground` for Hop's connection
  once, on first show (`WORKAROUND` in `HoldInkLayer`). Both private symbols are
  looked up at run time (`dlsym`), like every other private API in Hop: a macOS
  without them loses the pencil cursor, not the whole app at launch.
- **A lost key-up does not strand the layer** (security review, 2026-09-17). An
  event can go missing, for example when Secure Event Input starts while the
  chord is held, and the layer would stay over every screen taking clicks. While
  it shows, the controller checks twice a second whether the chord is still down
  (a modifier counts as down if either the event flags or its key state say so)
  and releases the layer if not. A pending chord key is swallowed only as a
  repeat; a fresh press means its key-up was lost and passes through.
- **Shift alone with a key is not a chord**: it would eat every capital letter.

Tests: `HoldChordTests`, `HoldGestureTests`.

### How the two markup modules reach the user

- **A clean install gets both, switched on**, at the foot of the first space.
- **An update gets both as well, switched on** (Anton, 2026-09-09), at the foot
  of its own first space — `ensure` appends a new module there. They are NOT
  swept into the inactive bucket and NOT offered as a checklist: the first
  version of this shipped them hidden behind a question, and a question about a
  module nobody has seen yet is answered blind. `newInThisRelease` is therefore
  empty; the machinery stays for a module that must not appear unasked.
  Switching either off is one click on its settings page.
- **The release card tells, and the full notes explain**: `"2.1"` carries three
  lines — the screenshot with its editor, the drawing layer, and the languages
  added — and its button opens the notes, where the release has a section of its
  own in every language. Each line names the job and then what to do
  with it ("screenshots with an editor: add captions and drawings…"), not the
  inventory of tools (Anton, 2026-09-09): a list of features is read as a list
  and answers nothing. Where the file lands is deliberately NOT on the card —
  the desktop is where a picture goes anyway, and saying so spends a line on
  what nobody wondered about. The handbook (`docShotFull`) opens on the same
  job and does name the desktop, because that is the page a folder question is
  taken to.

### Photographing the two markup modules

- **`--markup-shots <dir>`** writes the site's two pictures — a marked-up shot
  in its dressing, and the drawing layer over a screen with its yellow border.
  WORKAROUND: everything else is rendered from the
  real views by `ImageRenderer`, and these two cannot be — `MarkupCanvas` comes
  out of a headless render as a "missing picture" glyph (2026-09-09), and
  neither module has a window that holds still to be photographed anyway. The
  shots are composed straight in Core Graphics from the SAME renderers the
  export uses, so the marks on them are real marks. `make-screens.sh` runs it
  per language: the caption is translated.

### Saying where the picture went

- **A save that closes the window says nothing** (Anton, 2026-09-08): the
  editor's save button wrote the file and shut the window, and the picture
  looked lost. `MarkupNote` puts a small card OVER the button that was
  pressed: the file's name, the folder it went to, and "reveal in
  Finder". Clicking it opens Finder with the file selected. It holds four and a
  half seconds, stays as long as the pointer is on it, and lives in a window of
  its own — the editor's window is already gone by then, and the drawing layer
  never had one.
- The same card answers **copy**, with one word and no file to open, for a
  second and a half. The tick inside the button stays: it is the button's own
  state, and the card is the sentence.
- Both markup modules use it, from the same button positions their hints come
  from (`markupAnchor`).
- **A failure says so too** (found 2026-09-10). A save or a copy that did not
  happen used to end in silence, and the editor closed as if the file were
  written. The same card says "not saved" or "not copied", and the editor stays
  open with the picture in it. The drawing layer does not open without the
  screen recording permission, so on it the usual cause is a permission taken
  away while the layer was up. `Hop --snapshot <out.png> --note-cards` renders the failure cards beside
  the copy card, in the language and theme asked for.

### The markup toolbar (both modules)

- One panel, both modules. Dragged by anything that is not a button, and it
  **stays exactly where it is put** — no snapping to an edge, no turning
  (Anton, 2026-09-08): a panel that jumped to a side the moment it was let go,
  and stood on end when it got there, was fighting the hand that moved it. It
  **It goes anywhere, corners included, and may hang off an edge** (Anton,
  2026-09-09): it used to be kept WHOLE and 20pt inside the working area, so a
  panel pushed into a corner sprang back and the foot of the screen was out of
  reach. What is held now is 60pt of it on screen — enough to catch it again —
  and the whole display counts, menu bar included. `top`/`bottom` survives as one thing only — which way the
  popovers open, taken from which half the panel is in.
- **A drag is measured from where it STARTED, in a space that does not move**
  (Anton, 2026-09-08, 2026-09-09). The gesture reports the distance from the
  point the panel was picked up at; added to the frame the panel stands at NOW,
  that distance is applied again on every step and the panel bolts off the
  screen. Holding the place the drag began fixed that, but not the judder: the
  distance was still reported from inside a view travelling with every step, so
  each frame was measured against a point that had already moved. In the editor
  the gesture reads the pointer in the GLOBAL space and moves the panel by the
  difference. Over the live screen the panel is a window of its own and is moved
  to `NSEvent.mouseLocation` — the pointer's place on SCREEN, which does not
  travel with the window; it settles into its half of the screen when the drag
  ends. Handing the press to AppKit's own `performDrag` was tried first and
  dropped: SwiftUI takes the press before a view behind it sees one, and the
  panel stopped moving altogether (2026-09-09).
- **The colour popover is two rows of EIGHT**, and the wheel is the eighth of
  the second (Anton, 2026-09-09): seven recent colours are kept, so the columns
  line up under each other. The rule that used to stand before the wheel pushed
  the whole row half a swatch out of true.
- Colour and width live in a popover above the panel, never in the panel itself.
  Hovering a tool shows three lines: its name and its letter, one line saying
  what it does, and — for the tools that have settings — that a second press
  opens them (Anton, 2026-09-08). A row of glyphs is not self-explanatory, and
  the second press on the arrow, the caption and the blur was findable only by
  accident. `MarkupToolbar.about` per tool, translated like everything else.
  **Every button in the panel has one too**: back, forward, clear, copy, save,
  close, the width, the colour and the button that hands the screen back — that
  last one saying it is the SCREEN it hands over, not the marks.
- **Everything the panel opens stands ABOVE the drawing** (Anton, 2026-09-08):
  its popovers and the system colour wheel. Both open in windows of their own at
  ordinary levels, which is under the drawing layer — a click aimed at the
  colour wheel landed on the picture and drew another mark there. They are
  lifted to the shielding level plus two, one under the hint and one over the
  panel; the colour panel drops back to floating when it closes, since outside
  the live screen it has nothing to stand over.
- **The hint is Hop's own, not the system tooltip** (Anton, 2026-09-08). A
  tooltip belongs to a key window, and the panel over the live screen is a
  non-activating one that never becomes key: nothing ever appeared there.
  `MarkupTips` puts a small panel of its own beside the button — a quarter of a
  second's wait, above the button when the panel is low and below it when the
  panel is high, and never off the side of the screen. It takes no clicks.
- The drawing tools are one family of glyphs: each body is built upright and
  turned by the same 45°, and every silhouette is ONE closed outline — two
  shapes sharing an edge stroke it twice, and the joint swells at 19 pt (Anton,
  2026-09-07). Icons are checked by RENDERING them, not by reading the paths.
  The marker is a narrow barrel flaring into a chisel: an even barrel with a
  skirt read as a torch (Anton, 2026-09-08). The pencil is drawn TALLER than it
  looks it needs: turning a shape by 45° costs it a third of its height, and
  beside the upright glyphs it read as stubby. **"Clear" is the ONE glyph taken from the
  system** — `windshield.front.and.wiper`, a wiper across a windscreen, chosen
  from twenty candidates (Anton, 2026-09-08). A bin reads as throwing the
  picture out and the slim rubber beside it clears one mark rather than all of
  them; a broom, a swept frame, a board duster and a scrubbing brush were all
  drawn by hand first and none read at 19pt. The hand-drawn paths stay as a
  fallback for a system that cannot draw the symbol. Being the only borrowed
  glyph, it sits a shade heavier than the rest — that is the price of being
  understood.
- **Every glyph is outlined and filled ONCE**, never stroked piece by piece: at
  anything below full opacity the crossings of two strokes painted separately
  come out brighter than the lines themselves, which is how the panel's pencil
  looked half drawn (Anton, 2026-09-08). The arrow's shaft stops SHORT of the
  head's corner for the same class of reason — a round cap sitting on the joint
  pokes out of it as a bead on the tip.
- **The panel's own module rows do NOT use this family.** Their icons are SF
  Symbols, like every other row in the panel (`camera.viewfinder`,
  `pencil.tip`): the family belongs to the markup toolbar, and a hand-drawn
  glyph beside fifteen system ones reads as a mistake, not as a signature.

### Archive (drag & drop)

- Module key `"archive"`, title `archiveLabel` ("file archives"), with EVERY
  format spelled out on its own line under the name — "zip · rar · 7z · tar ·
  tar.gz · tar.bz2 · tar.xz · gz" — so the module reads as ZIP files rather than
  "putting something away in an archive" (Anton, 2026-07-25). An ellipsis was
  rejected: it leaves the reader guessing which formats it hides, and on the
  name's line the longest translations pushed the tail off. The list is built
  from `ArchiveFormat.allCases` via `displayName`, so a new case cannot go
  unlisted (tested both ways: named, and recognized back).
- **Adding is not starting** (Anton, 2026-07-25): a drop — or ⌘V, several files
  at once — fills a QUEUE (`pending`), and the work runs when the button is
  pressed. The queue decides which button that is (`plannedKind`): NOTHING BUT
  archives unpacks each one, anything else — files, folders, a mixed set — packs
  the whole queue into ONE archive, because collecting several things together
  reads as "make this one archive". A row can be taken back out; the list can be
  cleared.
- Results land on the DESKTOP by default (`archiveDestination`, `.desktop`): an
  unpacked folder has to appear where the user is already looking. `.alongside`
  keeps the old "next to the original" behaviour and `.custom` is any chosen
  folder (`archiveDestinationPath`, falling back to the Desktop if it has since
  gone missing). The pack format is a chip row (zip / tar.gz / 7z, stored in
  `archivePackFormat`, default zip) shown ONLY when the queue is going to be
  packed — an archive being opened comes out as whatever it already is, so the
  format has nothing to say about it.
- A write macOS refuses (the Desktop, Documents and Downloads folders are gated)
  is reported as `.denied` with its own row text, never as a generic failure:
  "nothing appeared" is the worst way to learn a folder needs consent. The
  usage-description strings ride in `Info.plist`.
- **Unpack layout**: the tool extracts into a hidden staging folder INSIDE the
  destination, then the result is lifted out: exactly one top-level item keeps
  its own name, several items go into one folder named after the archive. That
  gives both "no pointless wrapper" and "nothing scattered over the desktop"
  without listing the archive first, and the move is instant (same volume).
  Names never overwrite: `ArchiveRules.uniqueName` numbers them Finder-style
  ("photos 2.zip"), comparing case-insensitively because the default macOS
  volume is.
- **Staging lifecycle**: new folders are named
  `.hop-unpack-<launch UUID>--<job UUID>`. Before extraction, Hop removes only
  managed staging directories from older launches (including the legacy
  `.hop-unpack-<UUID>` form), preserving current-launch jobs so concurrent
  extracts cannot delete each other. Similar names, regular files and symlinks
  are never touched. Desktop and the configured custom destination are swept
  at launch; arbitrary alongside/Finder destinations are swept when the next
  extraction reaches them. Success, tool failure, empty output, permission
  failure and thrown errors all clean their own staging directory before the
  job finishes.
- Tools: zip via `ditto -x -k` (keeps macOS metadata a plain unzip drops),
  tar/tar.gz/tar.bz2/tar.xz via `tar -xf` (bsdtar detects compression and strips
  absolute paths), a bare `.gz` via `gunzip -c` into the archive's own stem.
  Packing runs WITH THE PARENT AS WORKING DIRECTORY on bare item names, so an
  archive holds "shoot/one.raw" and not this Mac's "/Users/…" path: `zip -r -q
  -X` (no `__MACOSX` junk) and `tar --no-mac-metadata -czf`.
- **rar / 7z** need the 7-Zip helper (`7zz`, ~6 MB), fetched on the FIRST drop
  that needs it and installed only after its Ed25519 signature checks out. Hop
  never CREATES rar — the format is proprietary and no free packer may write it,
  so `PackFormat` has no rar case at all (asserted by a test).
- Zip-slip: `ArchiveRules.isSafeEntryPath` rejects absolute and `..` entry paths
  (tested); staging inside the destination contains anything the tools let past.
- **The drop target is a WINDOW**, not the panel: a popover closes the moment a
  drag starts, pulling the target out from under the file (Anton, 2026-07-25).
  The module's panel row opens the archive window, exactly like the converter's;
  dropping onto the row still works and opens the window. The window is a
  `ConverterWindow` for its ⌘V handling (Hop has no Edit menu), and the
  converter's own paste monitor stands down while it is key. Its height follows
  its content the way the converter's does, so an empty module is a drop plate
  and nothing else — no gap underneath (Anton, 2026-07-25).
- **Default opener in Finder**, exactly like the torrent module's: a card in
  SETTINGS → the archives page (not in the window — being the opener outlives any
  window, Anton 2026-07-25). Two rules, both Anton's (2026-07-26):
  - **Only rar may be claimed, and macOS's own app is never overridden.**
    `claimableTypes` contains only `com.rarlab.rar-archive`, and skips it when
    its current handler is any `com.apple.*` bundle. Zip, tar, gz, bz2, xz and
    7z stay with Archive Utility. If a future macOS release learns rar, the
    claim card disappears automatically.
  - **The state is READ, never remembered.** `isDefaultHandler` asks Launch
    Services through `NSWorkspace` every time (and `DefaultHandlerCard` re-reads
    on every app
    activation), because the default can be changed in Finder at any moment and
    a control that disagrees with the system is worse than no control.
  Earlier Hop versions claimed every declared archive type. When the live
  Launch Services state shows that Hop still holds any non-rar type, settings
  show a recovery action that returns only those Hop-held non-rar types to
  `com.apple.archiveutility`; the action never changes rar or a third-party
  handler and disappears after the handoff. Handler reads and writes use the
  macOS 12+ `NSWorkspace` content-type API; the deprecated Launch Services
  setter is not used.
  **Every declared type carries its own document icon** (Anton, 2026-07-27):
  a sheet of paper with a folded corner, Hop's asterisk, and the format on an
  ink band at the foot — TORRENT, RAR, ZIP, 7Z, TAR, GZ, TGZ, BZ2, XZ. Before
  this every type pointed at `AppIcon`, so a folder of archives looked like a
  wall of duplicated apps and said nothing about what the files were. Documents
  are paper and the app is a cream plate precisely so the two are never
  confused. macOS shows the icon only where Hop is the registered opener, which
  is exactly the intent: the icon appears when Hop owns the file and not before.
  Each `.icns` is drawn per size rather than downsampled; below 64pt the label
  is dropped, because at that size any text is a smudge and Finder shows the
  file name anyway. The files are build output (`scripts/make-doc-icons.sh`),
  not stored assets, and `DocumentIconDeclarationTests` fails if a type is ever
  declared without its own icon or the generator and the plist drift apart.
  Settings also carry a "show in the panel" switch for the module itself: being
  the opener and occupying a row are separate decisions, and someone who only
  double-clicks archives in Finder should not have to dig through "modules &
  tabs" to reclaim the space (Anton, 2026-07-26). It flips membership, the same
  thing that table does — hiding is not switching off.
  `processOpenBatch` routes an opened archive into the extractor, and it works with
  the module HIDDEN — the panel row is a place to drop things, not a
  precondition for Finder. Finder-open is a separate path from the drop/paste
  queue: it extracts only the opened archive, always beside that archive,
  regardless of `archiveDestination`, and leaves queued items untouched. The
  manual archive window is never shown or populated by this path. Instead, each
  Finder open event immediately creates one small standalone progress window
  (one row per selected archive, with an indeterminate activity indicator
  because the command-line extractors provide no reliable fraction). It closes
  automatically once every archive succeeds; any denied/tool/empty/helper
  failure keeps it open with the human-readable reason. Closing the progress
  window manually does not cancel extraction. Several non-native archives in
  one event share one helper installation rather than racing duplicate
  downloads. Large batches scroll inside the bounded window. Choosing a final
  collision-free output name and moving the staged result are serialized, so
  simultaneous archives cannot select the same path. Dev and bundle-less builds
  never mutate global archive associations; only the production bundle exposes
  those writes. The types are declared in `Info.plist` with
  `LSHandlerRank: Alternate` (and `CFBundleTypeIconFile`, so Finder draws Hop's
  icon on the files it owns) — Hop offers itself without shouldering aside
  whatever the user already chose.
- Jobs are in-memory rows (max 4, running rows never trimmed) with a
  reveal-in-Finder action when done; snapshot flags `--archive` (panel) and
  `--window-archive` (the window itself) stage two.
- `ToolInstaller` is the shared download-verify-install mechanism (one trust
  root, `toolPublicKeyBase64`, signed with `scripts/sign-tool.swift`);
  `TorrentEngineInstaller` is now a thin subclass naming the rqbit manifest, and
  the 7-Zip helper is a second instance. Hop ships no third-party binaries: each
  is fetched only when its module actually needs it.

### Torrent engine: version floor and stall recovery (2.1.0)

Found on 2026-09-14 from a Korean home network: a torrent that had been
downloading sat at zero speed and zero peers after the lid had been closed for
eight hours, and came back the moment it was removed and added again.

- **Why.** rqbit 8.1.1 announces to HTTP trackers with no User-Agent, and
  trackers behind Cloudflare (Rutracker's `bt*.t-ru.org`) answer that with 403, so
  such torrents found peers through DHT alone. And rqbit's DHT does not survive a
  long sleep: its clock stops while the Mac sleeps, so the nodes that answered
  before still count as good, lookups keep asking the same eight of them without
  marking the silence, and the routing table is seeded from the bootstrap routers
  only when the process starts. Whether a network change alone does the same
  was not checked; the recovery below does not depend on the cause.
  With every node gone the engine had nothing else to fall back on. Removing the last torrent stops the engine and adding it back starts a
  fresh one, which is why that "fixed" it. rqbit 9.0.1 sends `rqbit 9.0.1` as its
  User-Agent; the CLI flags, API endpoints, JSON fields and session persistence
  Hop uses are unchanged (checked against the 9.0.1 source and a live 9.0.1
  process; `rqbit9-*` fixtures).
- **Version floor.** `ToolInstaller` records the manifest version beside the
  binary (`<binary>.version`) on every install. A tool may name a
  `minimumVersion` (`HopCore.ToolVersion.isBelow`, numeric per component); the
  engine's is 9.0.1, the 7-Zip helper and the remuxer name none and behave as
  before. An install with no recorded version counts as older than any floor.
  `TorrentController.startEngine` calls `updateIfNeeded()` before launching, so
  the engine is replaced while it is not running. If the update cannot be
  fetched or verified, the old binary stays and the engine starts with it. A
  manifest still naming a version below the floor (a stale cache) is ignored
  when a binary is already installed, instead of reinstalling the same old one
  on every start. An update is attempted at most once an hour, so a network that
  cannot reach the manifest does not slow every engine start, and the module
  keeps showing its torrents until an actual download begins. The new binary is
  staged beside the old one, made executable, and swapped in with one rename;
  the version file is written only after the swap, and a failed write fails the
  install (the next update attempt, an hour later or after a relaunch, installs it
  again). `scripts/sign-tool.swift` takes
  the version as its second argument so the printed manifest is complete.
- **Stall recovery.** `HopCore.TorrentStallWatch` reads each poll. A torrent is
  stalled when it is live, unfinished, unpaused, and has neither a live peer nor
  incoming bytes; anything unpaused with a live peer or traffic counts as
  flowing, and an unpaused torrent still initializing counts as checking. When
  every active download has been stalled for 180 s, nothing is flowing, nothing
  is checking (a restart would throw away a long re-check) and the Mac is
  online, the controller restarts the engine through `recoverEngine` (the path
  already used when the engine dies) and re-maps rows by info hash. Restarts are
  at least 600 s apart, and after 3 in a row that bring no traffic back the watch
  stops: each restart re-checks the payload on disk, and at that point the swarm
  rather than the engine is the problem. Traffic re-arms it, and so does a real
  network change from `NWPathMonitor` (alive only while polling): coming back
  online or a different set of interfaces. Repeated reports of the same path,
  as VPNs produce, do not. Going offline clears the stall timer. The clock is
  `systemUptime`, which stops while the Mac sleeps, so waking up is never read
  as three minutes of stall. The check adds no timer; it rides the existing
  1.5 s poll.
- **A failed restart is retried, not counted.** If no engine comes up,
  `recoverEngine` reports it and writes the error to the log; the attempt is
  not counted as fruitless, and polling tries again while torrents exist. The
  wait before the next try (`EngineRetry`) is 15 s, then doubles with every
  start in a row that fails, up to 10 minutes: an engine that can never start
  (a binary gone, a folder that cannot be written) used to be launched every
  15 s for as long as Hop ran (2026-09-15). Any engine that comes up, and a stop
  on purpose, set the wait back to 15 s. Any engine start after the
  first one in a session, including one triggered by a user action, re-maps rows
  on the next polls until the engine lists its torrents. A re-map drops only rows
  that existed before the list was requested, so a torrent added meanwhile
  stays. A stopped engine (the module switched off, the last torrent removed) is
  never restarted by recovery or by an action; only an add, restore or a
  removal starts it, and a removal stops it again once no row needs it.
- **Torrents are addressed by info hash.** rqbit accepts a 40-hex info hash
  anywhere it accepts a session id (`TorrentIdOrHash`, 8.1.1 and 9.0.1). Stats
  and every user action (pause, resume, file selection, remove) use the hash, so
  an action taken while the engine is restarting lands on the right torrent once
  the new session is up. An action that finds the engine down but still wanted
  starts it and waits, so a removal or a file selection is never silently
  dropped. A duplicate add is matched to its row by info hash alone.
- **Recovery keeps rows.** `recoverEngine` waits for the restarted engine to
  surface its session (the same ~3 s retry `restore()` uses) and leaves the rows
  alone if the list is still empty. Before, a restart that listed too early
  dropped every row and wrote the empty list to `torrents.json`.
- **Re-checking is not downloading.** While a torrent initializes, rqbit's
  `progress_bytes` is the amount hashed so far, measured against the whole
  torrent. Hop showed it as downloaded ("27 GB" on a torrent 9% done), then fell
  back once the torrent went live. `RqbitDecoding` now puts it in
  `TorrentStats.checkedBytes` with `progressBytes` 0, and the row reads
  "verifying · 45%" (`torrentVerifying`) from the first hashed byte until the
  torrent is live; before the first byte the row shows its usual progress.
  Snapshot: `--torrents-states`. Every `--torrents*` render now also opens the
  space holding the torrent module.

### Torrent removal and moved payloads (2.1.3)

Found on 2026-09-17: a film downloaded, moved out of Downloads and removed with
✕ kept coming back to Downloads as a 9 GB file.

- **A removal holds until the engine lets go.** ✕ used to drop the row, write
  `torrents.json` and send `forget`/`delete` without looking at the answer. With
  the engine stopped (the module switched off and on, a restart that failed)
  nothing was sent at all, and the torrent stayed in rqbit's own session: the
  next engine start resumed it with no row to show for it. Now the removal goes
  to `torrent-removals.json` (`HopCore.TorrentRemovals`) before anything else,
  the engine is started for it if it is down, and it is settled only by a list
  from the engine without that info hash. rqbit answers 500 "no such torrent" to
  a removal it already applied, so the answer itself proves nothing, and a list
  request that never answered is not an empty session: the removal then stays
  pending. Every failed step is logged under `com.antonshakirov.hop` / Torrents
  with the info hash. Every
  engine start sends the removals still pending; restore never shows their rows;
  adding the same torrent back cancels its removal. Deleting with files wins
  over an earlier plain removal of the same torrent.
- **Rows the session holds are shown.** Restore starts the engine when the
  session folder holds any `.torrent`, even with an empty `torrents.json`, so a
  torrent an older Hop failed to remove appears and can be removed. A restore
  that ends with no rows stops the engine unless an add is waiting on it.
- **A seeding torrent whose file is gone is paused.** The deletion probe used to
  skip finished torrents. rqbit keeps seeding from the file it already opened,
  so a payload moved away went unnoticed until the next engine start, which
  re-created every missing file at full length and downloaded it again. The
  probe (`TorrentLayout.watchesPayload`) now judges any live row with bytes on
  disk, finished or not. The "files removed" flag is persisted, and restore
  flags a finished torrent whose payload is missing before the engine starts,
  then pauses it.
- **The engine's placeholders leave with the torrent.** rqbit opens every
  payload file when it loads a torrent, paused or not, so a missing file comes
  back as a full-length file with no blocks behind it. Removing a "files
  removed" row without files deletes those placeholders
  (`TorrentLayout.emptyPlaceholders`: regular files exactly the length the
  torrent gives, with zero blocks; an evicted iCloud file or a network share can
  report zero blocks too, so the length must match, and a file flagged
  `SF_DATALESS` or `UF_COMPRESSED` is skipped). Files go with `unlink`, then the
  folders they leave empty up to the output folder with `rmdir`, which refuses a
  folder with anything in it; a file with any data in it is never touched.
  Pending removals keep only 40- or 64-hex info hashes, so a damaged file cannot
  put another string into the engine's URL path. Paths and hashes are logged
  private. The folder and the file
  list travel with the pending removal, so a removal that settles at a later
  engine start still clears them. The task that sends a removal stops the engine
  only when no add is waiting on it.
- Dev entry point: `Hop --torrent-removal-selftest <torrent> <folder>` walks
  finish, move away, restart, module off, ✕ against a real engine in the `.cli`
  storage.

### Converter: documents (1.5.0)

- A new `MediaKind.document` group in the SAME converter window and batch
  machinery: `md`, `markdown`, `txt`, `rtf`, `doc`, `docx`. Its chips choose the
  TARGET (`convDocTarget`: pdf / md / docx, default pdf) — the first category
  whose setting is a destination format rather than a compression level.
  Documents are matched by EXTENSION before the generic UTType checks, since
  `.md`/`.txt` conform to `public.text` and would otherwise fall through as
  unsupported. Size estimates are skipped for the group: a document changes
  shape, not weight, so a forecast would be noise.
- PDFs keep their own group and gain a MODE (`convPdfMode`: compress / markdown
  / docx, default compress) instead of moving categories — a dropped PDF still
  lands where the user expects. Word joined markdown on 2026-07-29: a pdf that
  has to be edited usually has to be edited in Word, and the machinery was
  already there (extract the text the way the markdown target does, lay it out
  again, hand it to the docx writer). In either extraction mode the quality
  slider is hidden: there is nothing to tune about extracting text.
- **Documents are set in Helvetica Neue, not the system font.** Printing an
  NSTextView set in San Francisco asks CoreText for `.SFNS-Regular…` BY NAME,
  gets Times New Roman substituted, and embeds a mapping under which Cyrillic
  extracts wrong: a heading written in Cyrillic came back with its "ka" turned
  into U+0138 (KRA), and copying that line out of the pdf in any reader gave the
  same (found 2026-07-29 while adding pdf → docx). Latin was unaffected, which is
  why it went unnoticed. A real embeddable family with a proper Cyrillic cut
  fixes it, and incidentally makes the output the deliberate typography the
  module claims rather than a silent Times fallback. Code blocks take Menlo for
  the same reason.
- **A paragraph is a code block only when ALL of it is fixed-pitch.** Reading the
  first run alone turned any paragraph that merely began with an inline
  `snippet` into a fenced block on the way back out of Word (found 2026-07-29 in
  a round-trip check). Links are the one thing that cannot survive that trip at
  all: AppKit's Word writer stores no hyperlink relationship, so a link arrives
  as plain text — said out loud in the module's help rather than left to be
  discovered.
- Output names drop the `-min` suffix for documents (`notes.pdf`, then
  `notes-2.pdf`): "-min" belongs to the compression story and would misdescribe
  what happened. A file already in the target format is REWRITTEN rather than
  refused — markdown comes back normalized, a Word file comes back clean.
- **Markdown engine is ours** (`HopCore.Markdown`), not a package: a
  CommonMark subset (headings, paragraphs with wrapped-line joining, lists,
  quotes, fenced code, rules; inline bold/italic/code/links with backslash
  escapes), plus a writer for the reverse direction. Zero dependencies, offline
  builds, and rendering we can pin with tests. The plan's swift-markdown route
  was dropped for that reason (Anton, 2026-07-25).
- **md → pdf**: markdown → `NSAttributedString` with Hop's own typography (A4,
  2cm margins, 22/17/14pt headings, 11.5pt body, monospaced code on a light
  fill) → an off-screen `NSTextView` printed via `NSPrintOperation` with
  `jobDisposition = .save`. That is what gives REAL pagination, and it is the
  same path a Word file takes, so images inside a .docx survive (an HTML detour
  would drop them — AppKit's HTML writer exports no images at all, verified).
- **docx/doc/rtf → pdf or md** through AppKit's own readers (what TextEdit
  uses). Structure is RECOVERED, not read: `HopCore.DocumentHeuristics` picks
  the body size as the most common size (ties to the smaller), then classifies
  by ratio (≥1.6 → h1, ≥1.3 → h2, ≥1.12 → h3, bold at body size → h3). Runs
  keep bold/italic/monospace/links as markdown markers; consecutive fixed-pitch
  paragraphs fold into one code block; an all-dashes line becomes a rule.
- **pdf → md** reads each page for its lines and their type sizes, then applies
  the same heuristics plus `continuesParagraph`: a PDF stores one run per VISUAL
  line, so wrapped lines are merged back into paragraphs unless the previous
  line ended a sentence or the next starts with a capital, a digit or a list
  marker. A page with NO text layer (a scan) is rendered at 2× and read with
  Vision — the screen-text module's recognition — using each box's height as its
  "type size" so the heading ratios still apply.
- **Reading a page is a fast path over a complete one** (`PDFContentScan` +
  `PDFLineMetrics`, 2026-08-04). The fast path takes the lines and their boxes
  from `selectionsByLine` and the type sizes from a walk of the page's own
  content stream, matching the two by vertical position: a segment belongs to a
  line when its baseline falls inside that line's box, and where a line carries
  several sizes the run with the MOST GLYPHS decides it (so a footnote mark
  cannot demote a heading, and a decorative capital cannot promote body text).
  Bold comes from the `BaseFont` name. Nothing is decoded from the stream —
  PDFKit stays the source of the text, so encodings and ligatures are unaffected.
  The complete path (per-page attributed strings) still runs whenever the fast
  one declines: a rotated page, a page whose text is drawn inside form objects,
  or any page where fewer than 90% of lines found a size (`coverageFloor`).
  Measured on four documents: same markdown out, 1.3× to 8.4× less time in,
  the spread being how much work a document's fonts give macOS — a page whose
  fonts it has to substitute cost 15 ms to lay out and 0.3 ms to walk.
- Honest limits stated in the UI (`convDocNote`) and the guide, not hidden: Word
  columns, footnotes and headers are lost; PDF → md is text extraction with
  heading guesses, not a faithful conversion.
- `isVerticallyCentered = false` on the print info: AppKit centres a PARTIAL
  page by default, which left the last page of a document floating in the middle
  of the sheet. Pages start at the top margin, like anything printed.
- The capability table lists what each category ACCEPTS and what it produces —
  and nothing else: the "what we cannot do" line is gone (Anton, 2026-07-25).
- **Video frames for the places video gets posted** (`VideoFrame`, Anton
  2026-08-04). Beside format, resolution and compression the video group has a
  `frame` row — `original`, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, 16:9 — and, whenever a frame other
  than the original is chosen, a `fit` row deciding what happens to a picture of
  another shape: `crop` (fill the frame, lose the edges — the default and what
  every platform does anyway), `bars` (all of it, empty space around it) or
  `blur` (all of it, over an enlarged blurred copy of itself). Ratios are
  written as ratios rather than platform names, which go stale.
  - The frame's SHORT side is the chosen resolution, so 1080 means 1080×1920 for
    a reel and 1920×1080 for a landscape one, and the sides are rounded to even
    numbers because encoders refuse odd ones.
  - **Nothing is ever upscaled.** A frame that would need more pixels than the
    source has shrinks, keeping its shape: 720p footage asked for a 1080-wide
    reel comes out 405×720, not an invented 1080×1920.
  - `crop` and `bars` are one layer instruction on an ordinary composition (the
    empty space is the frame's own black). `blur` goes through Core Image per
    frame — background scaled to COVER, clamped (a blur reads past the edge and
    would otherwise leave a transparent halo), blurred by 5% of the short side
    so a 4K export is blurred as much as a 540p one, with the picture composited
    over it. It is built ONLY when there is space to fill.
  - The size forecast runs the same composition, so the "→ ~N MB" beside a
    reframed group is the reframed size.
- Dev entry points (DEBUG only, like the torrent self-test):
  `Hop --doc-selftest <source> <pdf|md|docx|rtf|txt> <outDir>`,
  `Hop --video-selftest <source> <shape> <fit> <outDir>` and
  `Hop --page-selftest <file|address> <pdf|docx|md|rtf|txt|png> <outDir>`.

### Converter: web pages

- A `MediaKind.html` group of its own, beside documents rather than inside them:
  it is the only kind that is RENDERED rather than read, and the only kind whose
  batch row need not be a file on disk. It accepts `html`, `htm`, `xhtml`,
  `webarchive`, `mhtml`, `mht` — and a pasted address. Its chips
  (`convHtmlTarget`, default pdf) are pdf · docx · md · rtf · txt · png.
- **Two engines behind one row of chips**, split by `HTMLConversion.Target
  .rendersPage`. `pdf` and `png` lay the page out in WebKit, which is the only
  way the result looks like the page — its stylesheet, its fonts, its images.
  `docx`, `md`, `rtf` and `txt` READ it and travel the document path, so
  headings, emphasis, lists, tables and links survive and layout does not.
- **The pdf is WebKit's own render cut into sheets, not a print job.**
  `WKWebView.printOperation` is the obvious route and cannot be used here: run
  against the off-screen window this renderer needs, WebKit's print view never
  receives its layout back from the WebContent process, keeps the placeholder
  page range `1…NSIntegerMax` and prints until the disk fills — 1.6 GB in three
  minutes for a one-screen page, under every pagination mode and view size tried
  (2026-09-06). `createPDF` answers in milliseconds with ONE page as tall as the
  document, and `HopCore.PagePagination` works out the sheets: fit the width
  (never enlarging), then slice down the page. Refuses beyond
  `PagePagination.pageLimit` (2000) rather than half-writing a runaway.
  The honest cost, stated in the module note: the cut falls where it falls, so a
  line can land across a sheet boundary. A real print engine would avoid that.
- **Pages are laid out at 800 pt, the width a browser composes a printed page
  at** (A4 is 794 CSS pixels at 96 dpi). Both neighbours are wrong: the sheet's
  own printable width (523) trips the phone breakpoints that start at 768 and
  produced a phone screenshot stretched down a page, while a desktop width
  (1200) hands the whole window to the scaler — a site with a centred 654-wide
  column was shrunk by 1200/523 instead of by what it had drawn, and came out
  small and adrift in white space (measured 2026-09-06).
- **The reading path goes to the network only when there is no other way to the
  markup.** A plain `.html` on disk is read from disk, so asking for markdown
  never fetches anything. A web archive is not a file of HTML and an address has
  no file at all, so those load in WebKit and hand over `outerHTML`.
- **What fetches is stripped before AppKit reads it** (`HopCore.HTMLSource`):
  `script`, `style`, `iframe`, `object`, `video`, `audio`, `svg` and `noscript`
  go with their contents, `img`, `link`, `source`, `embed`, `track` and `input`
  go alone. Not sanitisation — nothing here is rendered or executed — but the
  difference between a conversion that finishes and one that hangs: AppKit's
  HTML reader fetches what the markup points at, synchronously, on the main
  thread. A stray `<` in prose stays text; a tag the document ends inside takes
  the rest of the document with it rather than printing its half as markup.
- **An address is a batch row without a file.** `addToBatch` lets a non-file URL
  past its existence check, `classify` calls anything that is not a file URL a
  page, and the row shows host + path with a globe where a thumbnail would be
  and no size — an address weighs nothing until fetched, and "0 B" would read as
  an empty file. Its result goes to the chosen destination, falling back to
  Downloads when that is "next to the original", which means nothing here.
- **Batch rows are told apart by the whole address, not the path**
  (`HTMLConversion.batchKey`, and `BatchFile.id` with it). By path,
  `example.com/post` and `other.com/post` collide and the second page dropped
  would silently never be added.
- A pasted address is accepted only when the pasteboard text reads as one and
  nothing else (`HTMLConversion.address`): an explicit http(s) scheme, or a bare
  host with no whitespace in it. A path, another scheme, prose, and a bare
  filename are all refused — "page.html" parses as a host whose domain is its
  extension, and fetching it would be a request nobody asked for.
- The snapshot is the WHOLE page in one image, the view grown to the document's
  height first; past `HTMLConversion.snapshotHeightCap` (16000 pt) it is scaled
  down rather than cropped, because an image cut at an arbitrary line looks like
  the page ended there.
- **A picture is refused past `HTMLConversion.renderHeightCap` (100000 pt)**
  (`canRenderWhole`), because the view really is grown to the document's height
  and the memory that costs grows with it: an off-screen view of 800 × 500000 is
  a backing store of 1.6 GB, and at the cap it is 330 MB. The limit is memory,
  not legibility — a page at the cap is already shrunk to 16% by
  `snapshotHeightCap` and nothing in it can be read (Anton chose the looser of
  the two bounds offered, 2026-09-06). The pdf has no such limit: `createPDF`
  never grows the view, and `PagePagination.pageLimit` bounds it instead.
- **Every answer from WebKit is taken under a 30 s watchdog that resumes once**
  (`PageRender.answer`), and `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate` settles a
  waiting one immediately. `createPDF`, `takeSnapshot` and `evaluateJavaScript`
  call back through the WebContent process, and a process that dies mid-answer
  never calls back at all: the continuation waiting on it is never resumed and
  the batch row spins for ever, with no result and no failure. A machine under
  memory pressure kills that process routinely (2026-09-06: with the swap full,
  three WebContent processes came and went inside one minute). A timed-out
  answer is a failed row, which is what the user needs to see.
- A page loads with media autoplay off (a batch must not start making noise) and
  under a 30 s timeout, so one page that never settles cannot hold the batch.
  `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` is entitled: WebKit compiles JavaScript at
  run time, and the hardened runtime otherwise kills the WebContent process
  mid-render — on a user's machine, never on a debug build (SigningTests).
- The document group gained `rtf` and `txt` targets in the same pass, the
  readers and writers being already in place.
- **A list marker is separated from its text by a space OR A TAB**
  (`DocumentHeuristics.listItem`). Word writes its lists with a tab and so does
  AppKit's HTML reader, so every `<ul><li>` and every Word list came back as
  prose with a stray bullet in it (found 2026-09-06). A number may carry its own
  punctuation or not: "1. first" and "1\tfirst" are both item one, and the
  two-digit guard that keeps "2026 was a year" prose still applies.
- Finished iWork exports and finished pages clear with everything else
  (`Batch.clearDone`); the iWork group had been left out of it.

### Keyboard lock (cleaning mode)

- Module key `"keyboard"`, title `keylockLabel` ("keyboard lock" — the name says
  what it does, Anton 2026-07-25). ONE line in the panel: name + the duration
  chips; tapping a duration LOCKS immediately, so there is no separate start
  button to press afterwards. While it runs the same line shows the countdown
  and an unlock button. A full-screen cover states what is happening and carries
  a way out. It sits ABOVE the Dock and below the menu bar
  (`CGWindowLevelForKey(.dockWindow) + 1`): at `.floating` the Dock drew over the
  cover and stayed clickable, which made the lock look like it had not taken
  (Anton, 2026-09-02). The menu bar is left uncovered on purpose — its
  locked-keyboard mark is what says why the keys do nothing.
- The keys are swallowed by a `CGEventTap` (session tap, head-insert) over
  keyDown, keyUp, flagsChanged AND `NX_SYSDEFINED` (14) — the brightness/volume/
  media row is not "keys" to macOS and would otherwise keep firing. Events are
  DROPPED, never inspected. `tapDisabledByTimeout/ByUserInput` re-arms the tap
  rather than leaving the keyboard half-locked.
- **The trust check and the tap creation are guarded apart.** The repair that
  follows a refusal drops Hop's TCC row, which is right when the permission is
  the problem and wrong when it is not: a tap that failed to be created under a
  working grant would have cost the user that grant.
- **The cover goes up only on a PROVEN lock** (Anton, 2026-09-02). Neither
  `AXIsProcessTrusted` answering yes nor `tapCreate` returning a tap says
  anything about whether events are really being stopped: macOS can keep a
  permission row from an older signature, and then every check reports success
  while every key still works. Proof is two taps and one event —
  `verifySuppression` posts a `systemDefined` event of subtype `0x4870` (a
  subtype nothing in macOS acts on, so it changes nothing either way) at the HID
  point, the main tap swallows it like any key, and a second listen-only tap at
  the ANNOTATED-session point — downstream of every session tap — listens for
  what got through. Locked means the main tap saw it and the downstream tap did
  not. Both halves matter: without the first, an event that was never posted at
  all would read as a perfect lock. If the second tap cannot be created the
  first half stands alone, which is weaker than this wants and still stronger
  than trusting a permission check. It costs the 0.06s grace after the probe
  arrives, not the 0.3s deadline, which is only for the probe that never comes.
  The measurement gets TWO retries before a refusal, because refusing a lock
  that would have worked is its own kind of lie and a probe can go missing
  without the permission being at fault: the probe and its deadline both wait on
  the main run loop, so a main thread busy past 0.3s can have the deadline win a
  race it should have lost. Retries cost nothing on the path that succeeds, and
  they matter most to the people who have nothing wrong with their permission —
  they are the ones a false refusal would send looking for a problem that is not
  there (Anton, 2026-09-02).
- **The panel closes on the LOCK, never on the click** (Anton, 2026-09-02).
  `lock(seconds:then:)` hands `then` true only once the keyboard is measurably
  locked; the module's chip closes the panel from inside that. A panel that
  shuts on the click leaves nothing on screen to carry the bad news, and the
  user goes off wiping a keyboard that was never locked. What that looked like
  from the outside was the F row firing under the cover — the volume moving, do
  not disturb going on — because those are the only keys whose effect is visible
  while a full-screen cover holds the focus.
- **The durations stay on the row whatever the permission is doing.** The row
  used to swap its figures for an "open settings" link, which left nothing to
  press — and pressing is how you find out anything is wrong in the first place.
  A refusal leaves the panel open, with the banner above the modules and the
  system's own dialog in front of it.
- **A watchdog runs at 1 Hz for as long as the lock does**, endless locks
  included: the ticker is no longer only a countdown. `TapWatchdog.step` is
  given `CGEvent.tapIsEnabled` and whether last tick already re-armed it, and
  answers fine / re-arm / give up. macOS switches a tap off when its callback
  overruns, and the disable arrives as an event the callback re-arms from — but
  that path needs an event, and the whole point of the lock is that no events
  arrive. Two ticks off in a row ends the lock and says so in a notification
  (`keylockBroken`): a cover left over a live keyboard is the one outcome worse
  than no lock at all.
- The POWER key: a SHORT press is swallowed like every other key — on a
  cleaning cloth it is the one press that would put the Mac to sleep mid-wipe.
  Holding it still forces the Mac off, because a long hold is handled in
  hardware and never reaches a tap at all: the emergency exit stays open without
  Hop having to leave the short press alive (Anton, 2026-07-25). Touch ID keeps
  working.
- Way out, four of them: the cover's done button, the module's own unlock
  button, simply opening the panel — reaching for Hop while the keys are dead IS
  the ask to release them — or HOLDING ESC + SHIFT for five seconds when the
  mouse is out of reach. A CHORD, not a lone key: something resting on the
  keyboard can hold one key down for minutes, and that must not undo a cleaning
  lock (Anton, 2026-07-26). `noteChord(escape:shift:)` tracks both from the tap
  (shift comes off `event.flags`, so a bare modifier change updates it too) and
  arms a real Timer — shift never auto-repeats, so there would be nothing to
  count. The Timer is a BACKSTOP, not the only clock: every later event
  (esc auto-repeats ~30 times a second) re-checks the elapsed time against the
  start, because a timer on a run loop busy with the cover's animation fires late
  and the release then trails the full bar by half a second (Anton, 2026-07-26).
  The bar fills AT the deadline, not before it: it used to aim 0.15s early so a
  finished bar would never sit waiting, but it never finished, so that wait was
  invisible — and once it did finish, the lead was the whole of what "it took
  longer than five seconds" felt like (Anton, 2026-09-02). It reads its progress
  off `chordSince` through a `TimelineView` rather than off an implicit
  animation. Handed to an animation it
  was late by a third: the countdown redraws the cover every second, each redraw
  started a fresh 4.85s animation from wherever the bar stood, and so it covered
  a fifth of what remained each second and never the rest — 21%, 37%, 50%, 60%,
  about two thirds at the moment the keys came back. A bar that promises a
  deadline has to be read off the clock (Anton, 2026-09-02). Both keys are still swallowed on the way through, and the cover states
  the chord on its own line, heavier than the rest, with a bar that fills over
  the five seconds while the pair is held and snaps back the moment either key
  goes up (`chordHeld`) — a five-second hold with no feedback is five seconds of
  wondering whether it works. A normal keyboard shortcut would be exactly the thing
  that is switched off. Durations are 1 / 5 / 15 minutes and ∞
  (`durations = [60, 300, 900, 0]`, 0 = until told otherwise); the countdown is
  replaced by the infinity glyph in that mode.
- **Unlocking is ordered, not merely correct** (Anton, 2026-07-27): `unlock()`
  removes the tap, then orders the cover out, then hands focus back to whichever
  app was frontmost when the lock went up (remembered in `showOverlay`, before
  `NSApp.activate`) — and only then updates the published state. Two things made
  a correct unlock feel half a second late. Publishing `isLocked` while the cover
  was still on screen bought a SwiftUI layout pass on the way out. Worse, Hop is
  an accessory app: after activating itself to catch the cover's click it stayed
  frontmost, so the keys were free but the first thing typed went to no window at
  all. If the earlier app is gone, Hop hides itself instead, which hands focus to
  whatever macOS picks next.
- **The menu bar says so**: while locked, the star is REPLACED by a keyboard
  glyph — a corner dot would be too quiet for a state that stops the whole
  keyboard, and it outranks the finished bell. Unlocking plays the
  keep-awake "off" cue, so the release is audible without looking.
- The cover sits at `.floating`, deliberately BELOW the menu bar: the mark up
  there is the explanation for dead keys and must stay visible.
- Permission: **Accessibility**, asked with `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`
  BEFORE the lock — without it the tap silently never fires and the cover would
  promise a lock that isn't there. The module then offers the deep link.
- Hotkey `⌃⌥K`, module-gated like the other module hotkeys. The tap dies with
  the process, so a crash can never leave a locked keyboard behind.

### Hotkeys (settings window)

- **Every combination in one page and every one of them rebindable**
  (Anton, 2026-09-01): the panel's own, the modules that answer a key, and the
  eighteen window zones — each drawn as the shape it puts a window in plus its
  combination. Recording is the same click-then-press it always was.
- **Anything changed can be handed back, one group at a time.** A row whose
  combination is not the one it shipped with grows a ↺
  (`HotkeyManager.isDefault`/`reset`), and each card is followed by its OWN
  "reset defaults" button — the panel and the modules under the first card, the
  eighteen zones under the second — greyed out and unpressable while that group
  is untouched. One button at the foot of the page reset the zones together with
  everything else and sat below the fold besides (Anton, 2026-09-02). Reset means
  "forget the stored value", so the default is not copied anywhere and a later
  change of default reaches everyone who never rebound.
- The window-manager module's page keeps only its layout picker: the zone keys
  and their on/off switch live here, where keys live.
- **A function names its own key, and the zones move around IT** (Anton,
  2026-09-08). ⌃⌥ plus the first letter of what the thing is called: **S**
  screenshot, **D** draw on screen, **T** timer, **A** awake, **C** convert and
  compress, **F** file archives, **U** uninstall apps, **K** keyboard lock,
  **H** Hop's own panel. Two take a later letter because the first is spoken
  for: text recognition keeps **R**, and the colour picker takes the **O** of
  cOlour — the converter is reached far more often than the picker, so it gets
  the C (Anton, 2026-09-08). Every module that can be opened by a key now ships
  with one; nothing is left blank in the list. This reverses the earlier call
  (2026-09-02) that the zones keep every letter and the modules move around
  them: a shortcut nobody can guess is a shortcut nobody uses, and the zones are
  a grid whose keys are arbitrary either way. Eight zones move to the number row
  for it, and the arrows, ↩ and the rest of Rectangle's map are untouched.
  `ModuleCatalogTests.testEveryDefaultIsTheFirstLetterOfWhatItDoes` holds the
  letters and `testNoTwoActionsShipTheSameCombination` fails if any two shipped
  combinations ever meet again. Reset means "forget the stored value", so
  anyone who never rebound a key gets the new one on update.
- **One right edge down the page.** In a right-aligned row the combination chip
  comes LAST, with the ↺ and any "shortcut is taken" ahead of it: the ↺ slot is
  held whether or not it shows, and keeping it after the chip pushed every
  hotkey 20pt short of the edge the switches below sit on (Anton, 2026-09-02).
  The zone grid is left-aligned and keeps the plain chip-then-↺ order, where the
  reserved slot costs the edge nothing.
- **A key answers only while its module is on.** No dimmed rows: a
  switched-off module's row leaves the page with the module, and its
  combination is free again (Anton, 2026-09-05). There is still no "keep the
  keys of modules that are off" switch — the setting that used to undo this only
  made the page harder (Anton, 2026-09-02), and the switch that decides is the
  module's own. The zones keep their extra on/off switch, which is about
  eighteen keys at once rather than about the module.

### Permissions (settings window)

- An "app permissions" page — fourth in the sidebar, because it is the page
  people go looking for (Anton, 2026-07-26) — listing EVERY permission Hop can
  ask for, what it is for, and whether it is granted right now — plus what Hop
  never does. The list is taken from the code (actual API calls), never written
  from memory; a new permission means a new row.
- **One row per PERMISSION, not per feature, and one line each** (Anton,
  2026-09-02). Network used to be three rows — updates, torrent traffic, the
  speed test — for what macOS treats as one thing; they are now a single row
  naming all three uses. Six rows in total: network, Accessibility
  (paste-into-app, window manager, keyboard lock, drawing while a key is held), Screen Recording (screen text,
  screenshots, and the loupe and the blur on the drawing layer — the
  eyedropper explicitly does not need it), notifications (timer +
  torrent done), administrator password (once, for closed-lid `pmset`), launch
  at login. Each body is one sentence: a paragraph per permission read as a
  wall, and the page is scanned rather than studied. A seventh row — `restart` —
  joins them once something has been asked for in this run; see the restart under
  "A permission that goes missing says so".

### Lid mode without a password

- The closed-lid mode runs `pmset disablesleep`, which is root-only, so the first
  use raises one macOS password prompt and installs
  `/etc/sudoers.d/hop-pmset` — NOPASSWD strictly for `pmset disablesleep 0/1`,
  validated by visudo. After that `sudo -n` carries it with no dialog ever again.
- **The password row shows no state, deliberately.** Whether the next use will
  ask cannot be read: `sudo -n -l <command>` answers success for anything the
  policy allows at all, password or not (measured, 2026-09-03), and the only
  exact test is running `pmset` itself, which a page redrawn every two seconds
  must not do. What CAN be read is whether Hop's own rule is on disk
  (`/etc/sudoers.d` is world-readable, Hop is not sandboxed), and that is used
  only to offer the button below.
- Hop's rule is not the only way the prompt can stay away: another app's rule for
  the same command serves Hop just as well. Anton's Mac carried
  `vorssaint-clamshell`, so the lid mode worked on the short path and Hop never
  installed a rule of its own (2026-09-03). Nothing is wrong with that — if the
  other rule goes, the next toggle asks once and installs Hop's.
- **A launch takes back a no-sleep state nobody turned off.** Lid mode is undone
  when the awake session ends and when Hop quits, but a crash or a `kill` runs
  neither, and the Mac is then left never sleeping with no sign of why.
  `lidSleepAppliedPending` records that `disablesleep` is ours, and
  `revertLidIfPending` (from `init`) puts it back. Only over `sudo -n`: a
  password dialog on launch is not something the user asked for, so where the
  silent path is gone the flag simply stays and the next toggle settles it.
- **`revoke` gives it back** (`KeepAwakeController.removeLidRule`): where Hop's
  own rule exists, the administrator-password row carries the button. It restores
  sleep and deletes the rule under ONE prompt, in that order — dropping the rule
  while `SleepDisabled` is 1 would leave a Mac that never sleeps and no way for
  Hop to change it without asking again.
- The rule cannot be removed on uninstall from inside the app: Hop is dragged to
  the Trash and its code does not run at that moment. `brew uninstall --zap`
  deletes it (the cask's `zap delete:`), and the button covers everyone else.
- Live status where it can be checked: `AXIsProcessTrusted()`,
  `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`, `UNUserNotificationCenter` settings,
  `SMAppService.mainApp.status`. The notification query is skipped in a
  bundle-less process (a snapshot render throws otherwise). Re-read on a 2s
  tick while the page is open: a grant lands in another process (the system
  dialog, the settings pane) and none of those four checks publishes anything to
  watch, so the only way the list stops lying is to look again.
- **The trailing slot holds ONE thing: the button, or the status** (Anton,
  2026-09-02) — a row that says "not granted" AND carries a button says the same
  thing twice. Missing and askable → the "grant access" button; granted → the
  green word; nothing to check → "asked when used". The System Settings link is
  gone from the rows: the button does what the link was there to lead to.
  Accessibility and Screen Recording ask
  through `PermissionRepair.askByHand` (drop Hop's own row, then request),
  which is the only thing that raises the real dialog when the row already
  there grants nothing — and, once the row has been dropped in this run, the
  list in System Settings instead (see "Hop's own row is dropped at most once
  per run"); notifications ask
  `UNUserNotificationCenter.requestAuthorization` and fall back to the
  notification pane once macOS answers from a refusal on file; launch at login
  is `SMAppService.mainApp.register()`. A button asks as often as it is pressed,
  unlike a feature's own automatic repair.
- The same list, condensed, is a README section (every language) and a FAQ
  answer on the landing (all 8).
- The page CLOSES with a statement, set larger and bolder than anything above
  it: the permissions exist so features can work, nothing about the user is
  collected, nothing leaves the Mac — and, because a promise is worth little,
  a link to the source (Anton, 2026-07-26). A list of permissions reads as a
  list of risks until somebody says plainly what is NOT happening.
- Snapshot: `--permissions` opens the settings window on that page.

### A permission that goes missing says so (panel banner)

- One macOS switch governs three features — the keyboard lock, the window zones
  and the clipboard's paste — and all three used to answer a missing permission
  with `return`. Nothing appeared anywhere: the zone did not move a window, the
  paste did not paste, the lock closed the panel and did nothing. A signed
  release made that everybody's problem at once, because macOS ties a permission
  to the code signature and 1.9.1 changed it (Anton, 2026-09-02).
- `AccessibilityWatch` (one shared object) holds the live answer, and
  `AccessibilityVerdict.alert` — pure, in HopCore, tested — turns three facts
  into one of four states. `granted` is `AXIsProcessTrusted()`. `wasGranted` is
  remembered in `UserDefaults` the first time a grant is ever seen, and only
  ever written true. `suppressionProven` is the keyboard lock's measurement,
  nil until one is made.
  - `.none` — nothing owed.
  - `.missing` — never granted here.
  - `.lost` — granted before, gone now: an update that changes the signature
    takes it back, and macOS does not ask again on its own, since its dialog
    appears only where no decision is on file and an old row counts as one.
  - **Both of those say to remove Hop from the list and add it again, not
    merely to grant the permission** (Anton, 2026-09-02, from his own Mac). The
    switch and the permission are separate things: `AXIsProcessTrusted()`
    answered false for Hop Dev while System Settings showed its switch ON,
    because the row belonged to the previous signature. Sending somebody to a
    switch that is already on, with nothing to press, is worse than saying
    nothing. Neither state can be told apart from a plain refusal through any
    API, so the sentence has to cover both — and the population this was written
    for lands on `.missing`, since no released version ever wrote `wasGranted`.
  - `.stale` — macOS says granted, the measurement says events are not being
    stopped. The only state where opening the switch is not the fix; the row has
    to be removed with the minus button and added again. No API reports it, so
    only the keyboard lock's probe can put the panel into it.
- **The panel explains nothing and leaves in six seconds** (Anton, 2026-09-02).
  One line above the release card — "hop has no accessibility yet" and the
  System Settings link — and `featureWasBlocked` expires on a timer, taking it
  away. macOS is already asking with its own dialog, which is the only thing
  that can actually grant the permission; a panel lecturing on top of that is
  one surface too many, and a standing banner turns a moment into furniture.
  There is no title and no paragraph: the earlier version had both and they
  explained a situation the user could do nothing with from inside the app. The
  one button says "grant access" and runs the repair — it used to open System
  Settings, which is the wrong destination when Hop's switch there is already on
  (Anton, 2026-09-02).
- **NO state announces itself before something has actually been stopped by it.**
  Hop is a timer and a converter to plenty of people, and a permission they
  never needed is not news. A permission that works again also retires the line
  and re-arms the single notification for whatever fails next.
- `.stale` is the one verdict re-reading cannot clear — macOS reports that state
  as granted both before and after the repair — so a panel opened while it
  stands has `KeyboardLockController.remeasure()` take the measurement again,
  tap and probe and all, without locking anything.
- **The repair is `tccutil reset <service> <bundle id>` followed by the app's
  own request** (`PermissionRepair`). Opening System Settings is useless when
  the row is already there with its switch on: there is nothing to press.
  Dropping Hop's own row puts the decision back to "not made", and the request
  that follows shows the real system dialog.
- **macOS does the asking, and Hop opens nothing on top of it** (Anton,
  2026-09-02). A refused feature runs that repair itself — the trust check is
  the plain `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, so the one dialog comes from the repair
  rather than two from both. A feature that stops does not open System Settings
  on its own: it took the focus, hid the very dialog that grants the permission,
  and closed the popover carrying the explanation, so the whole thing read as
  Settings opening for no stated reason. Two later rules open a window on
  purpose, both below: a module that reads the screen opens Hop's permissions
  page on every attempt, and a "grant access" press after Hop's row was already
  dropped in this run opens the list in System Settings.
- A feature that is merely stopped asks ONCE per run per service
  (`PermissionRepair.askAgain`), so a zone dragged five times does not raise
  five dialogs. `.stale` never repairs itself: there the permission IS granted,
  the measurement can fail for reasons that are not the permission's fault, and
  throwing away a working grant on a guess is the worse trade. That one waits
  for the button.
- **The line that says a permission is missing IS the button** (Anton,
  2026-09-03). The recognition row's yellow "needs screen recording" and the same
  words in the recognition window are pressable and ask on every press
  (`PermissionRepair.askByHand`), because a press is somebody asking. Before a
  request, `NSApp.activate` — Hop is an accessory app, so the dialog macOS
  raises for it opens BEHIND whatever is in front, which is what "I press it and
  nothing happens" was.
- Screen Recording gets the same repair on the FIRST refusal. The earlier
  two-step (a plain `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` first, the repair only on a
  second press) shows NOTHING when the list already holds a row that grants
  nothing, so the first press ended in "allow it in settings" pointing at a
  switch that was already on — which is exactly what Anton hit on 2026-09-02
  pressing the recognition hotkey.
- **Hop's own row is dropped at most once per run** (`PermissionAsk.plan`,
  found 2026-09-10). Every press of "start" on the drawing layer used to run the
  whole repair, `tccutil reset` included: two presses four seconds apart dropped
  Hop Dev's Screen Recording row twice, no dialog came up either time, and the
  layer never opened. The first drop in a run is the one that clears a row left
  behind by an old signature. A row that appears after it is the user's own
  answer — as often as not a switch turned on and still waiting for the
  restart — and dropping it again throws that grant away. So after the first
  drop a feature only requests, and a "grant access" button opens the list in
  System Settings instead, with no request pulling Hop back in front of it.
  `PermissionAskTests`.
- **Screen recording is asked for before a module that reads the screen opens,
  and asked again on every attempt** (Anton, 2026-09-10). Screen text, the
  screenshot and the drawing layer read pixels
  (`ModuleCatalog.needsScreenRecording`; the colour picker samples through the
  system and records nothing). Asked at the moment a tool needed a frame, the
  ask landed in the middle of a job that was already broken. So opening any of
  them without the permission — the panel button, the hotkey — opens nothing,
  and opening or turning one on — the power button, the switch on its page,
  "turn on" on the new-module card, saving the module picker with it ticked —
  asks EVERY time, round and round until the permission is there, never once
  per run (`PermissionRepair.askForTheScreen`):
  - the request goes to macOS, which shows its dialog where it still will;
  - the settings window opens on the permissions page, because the dialog is
    not guaranteed: on 2026-09-10 a press raised none, and a press that shows
    nothing reads as a broken button. The page carries the Screen Recording
    row and the `restart` row, and a switch turned on in System Settings only
    reaches the running Hop through that restart;
  - while the wizard is up the page does not open — onboarding asks in its
    permissions step, as before.
  `ModuleCatalogTests.testOnlyModulesThatReadTheScreenNeedScreenRecording`.
- **A refusal or a failed capture does not lock the module** (found
  2026-09-10). The screenshot capture kept `.denied` and `.failed` as states
  that refused every later press, so granting the permission afterwards still
  left the hotkey dead until Hop restarted. Only a capture in progress refuses
  a press; the other states are left behind by the next one.
- **Every permission is cleared once, on the first run of 1.10.0**
  (`PermissionRepair.resetEverythingOnce`, `tccutil reset All <bundle id>`, flag
  `permissionsReset.1.10.0`): 1.9.1 changed the signature, so a Mac that had
  granted anything before it carries rows that answer for Hop and grant nothing,
  and no API tells such a row apart from a working grant. Everything Hop can hold
  goes — Accessibility, Screen Recording, Automation, files — and each one is
  asked for again from scratch, which is the only way a request raises the real
  dialog (Anton, 2026-09-03). Launch at login is NOT touched: it is a setting
  rather than a permission, and clearing it would leave Hop silently not starting
  in the morning. `AccessibilityWatch.forgetGrant()` drops the remembered grant
  in the same breath, so what follows reads as `.missing` — never granted here —
  rather than as `.lost`, whose wording sends people hunting in the list for a row
  the reset removed.
- The card that explains it is the release card for 1.10, whose button opens the
  permissions page rather than the notes: the release took the permissions away,
  and that page is where each one is given back. It is the one release card whose
  `destination` is not `.updates`.
- The cost, stated and accepted: somebody whose permissions worked has to grant
  them again. A blanket reset was refused for 1.9.2 for exactly that reason and
  taken for this release, because the alternative leaves everyone whose grant is
  dead with no way to tell (Anton, 2026-09-03).
- **A permission granted while Hop runs needs a restart, and the restart comes
  back to the page** (`AppRelaunch`, Anton 2026-09-03). macOS answers a
  permission question once per process, at launch: the switch goes on, the row
  can even say "granted", and the running app still refuses. Restarting by hand
  loses the settings window in the middle of granting the rest — which is exactly
  when several permissions are being handed over one after another. So the
  permissions page grows a `restart` row with a button, `AppRelaunch.now` writes
  `reopenSettingsSection`, and the next launch opens the settings window on that
  page. The relaunch itself is the updater's trick: a detached shell waits for
  this process to die, then `open`s the bundle, because a plain `open` would only
  activate the instance still running.
- The restart row appears only once something has been asked for in this run
  (`PermissionRepair.askedAnythingThisRun`) — a page opened to read what Hop uses
  never carries it. `--restart-row` draws it for a snapshot.
- The zones and the paste report themselves when they are stopped. The zones
  also post a notification — they are used with the panel shut, so the banner
  alone would arrive far too late — one per run, never one per failed drag. The
  paste does not: the copy went through, the entry IS on the clipboard, and the
  panel it was clicked in is still open to carry the reason.

### What's-new card (module checklist)

**The list is empty, and that is the rule, not the current state.** A card
offering to switch a module on has exactly one honest reader: somebody who was
using Hop before that module existed. Everybody else has already chosen. An old
user arranged their panel by hand; a new one answered the same question in the
wizard, which marks every announcement read as it finishes. Asking either of
them again reads as if the app had forgotten them.

So an entry is added for one reason only: a module that did NOT exist before the
release being shipped. It is removed in the release after that. The four cards
that used to live here - torrents, the 1.5 tools, vpn with a grid of apps, the
uninstaller - outlived their releases by years and are gone (2.0.1).

A card also retires itself: `retireSatisfiedAnnouncements` marks it read at
launch once every module it offers is already in the panel, so switching one of
them off later does not bring the question back
(`FeatureOffer`, `FeatureOfferTests`).

The shape below is what an entry looks like when one is earned.

- A release that introduces modules announces them as a CHECKLIST: one switch
  per module, all OFF, plus save/hide. Nothing appears in the panel that was not
  ticked - a single "enable" button pushes modules at people who have not asked. Saving places the ticked modules on the FIRST space,
  whichever space happens to be open, and hides the rest.
- For an UPDATING user every module introduced in the release starts hidden
  (`newInThisRelease`, one-shot `optInModulesSeeded`); a fresh install has no
  expectations to violate, so only the permanently opt-in tools
  (`optInModules`: eyedropper, screen text) stay hidden there.
- The archive row carries a SECOND switch of its own — "open archives with Hop"
  — because a decision worth making about archives is also worth making right
  here (Anton, 2026-07-25). It is not a module key (`archive.defaultHandler`,
  deliberately outside `moduleKeys` so nothing tries to place it on a tab), it is
  offered even when the module itself stays hidden, and saving only ever CLAIMS
  the types: an untouched switch must not hand back an opener chosen earlier.
- The torrent card keeps its own two-step shape (opt-in, then follow-up
  settings while the engine downloads); `FeatureAnnouncement.checklist`
  picks which shape a card takes.
- `modules160` announces the VPN list and a grid of apps. The apps row is the
  only entry that is NOT a module key: it is the bare word `apps` (`appsChoice`),
  a REQUEST for a grid, because the launcher exists only once a grid does.
  Ticking it creates one and places it — and it must be introduced to the tabs
  model (`ensure`) before being placed, since placing a module the model has
  never seen is a no-op. Its row carries a one-line detail, like archives: the
  word "apps" alone does not say what the module is.

## Agent bridge (files and hop:// links)

Hop can be READ and DRIVEN from outside — by the user's own AI agent, a script,
or a Shortcut — through two plain JSON files in the app's Application Support
folder, plus a URL scheme. Files rather than a socket or a CLI because that is
the surface an agent already has: it can read and write files without being
taught anything.

- `agent-commands.json` — written by the agent, performed, then EMPTIED by the
  app. The emptying is the acknowledgement. A file that parses to nothing usable
  is left alone rather than silently eaten, so a malformed write can be seen.
- `agent-state.json` — written by Hop every 5s and after every command: timer
  mode/state/remaining, keep-awake, the tracking task and its today total, the
  whole to-do list with notes, reminders and favourites, `accessibility` —
  `none` / `missing` / `lost` / `stale`, the reason `keyboard.lock` or
  `window.snap` did nothing — and `screenRecording`, the same answer for
  `ocr.read`. An agent sees neither the system dialog nor the
  panel's banner, so without those fields the only thing it can report back is
  that its command was accepted and changed nothing.
- `hop://` links carry the SAME vocabulary — `hop://timer/start?minutes=16`,
  `hop://todo/add?text=…&important=true&repeatDays=mon,wed`, `hop://tracker/stop`.
  This is what a Shortcut can open, so anything the system can trigger a Shortcut
  from can reach Hop.
- The vocabulary covers the app rather than one module: the timer and stopwatch,
  the tracker, to-dos (add with note/reminder/repeat/star, complete, delete),
  keep-awake with an optional duration, lid mode, the keyboard lock, window
  snapping to any of its 18 positions, the speed test, the eyedropper, text
  recognition, putting text on the clipboard, and opening the panel.
- It is a CLOSED list of verbs (`AgentCommand`), not "set any field":
  `timer.start` is unambiguous, while a declarative "timer: running" would leave
  the app guessing whether to restart a timer the user just paused. Parsing is
  deliberately forgiving (`AgentCommandParser`, pure, tested) — the writer is a
  language model: `do`/`command`/`action` are all accepted as the verb key, a
  bare array works as well as `{"commands": […]}`, durations may be `seconds`,
  `minutes`, `hours` or `"1h30m"`/`"25:00"`/a bare number of minutes, weekdays
  may be numbers or names, and ONE bad entry never discards the rest.
- `todos.json` and the command file are watched (`FileWatcher`, coalesced 0.3s,
  re-arming on the delete/rename that a replacing writer produces), so a task an
  agent appends to `todos.json` appears while the app runs instead of being
  overwritten by its next save.

## Shared components

- **Button order is macOS's, everywhere a pair of options is drawn** (Anton,
  2026-09-02): the action the surface is about sits on the TRAILING edge, cancel
  to its leading side. That covers the tab and grid delete cards, the in-row
  delete confirm (`RowDeleteConfirm`), the torrent remove row (the harsher
  "delete with files" pushed to the leading edge, then cancel, then "remove
  torrent"), the inline field's ✕/✓ (`FieldCommitButtons`), the quit
  confirmation and the torrent add sheet — the last two already read that way.
  Where the confirm REPLACES a hover ✕, a dead slot the ✕'s own width is held at
  the trailing end so the pointer's spot answers to nothing; that, not a
  reversed order, is what stops a reflexive second click from deleting.
- The converter and archive rows are the SAME card: icon 12, gap 6, name at
  mono 11, a `RowActionIcon` on the trailing edge, `padding(.horizontal, 10)` /
  `padding(.vertical, 9)` on `Theme.rowBg` — 40pt tall, both of them (Anton,
  2026-07-26). A bare `Image` on one of them and the shared icon on the other is
  what made them differ by a hair.
- **ModuleMarkIcon (Controls.swift) is the ONLY module mark**: a fixed 16×14
  frame around a 12pt symbol. SF Symbols differ in HEIGHT too — `doc.zipper` is
  a tall document, `archivebox` a squat box — so the converter card came out
  1.5pt taller than the archive card beside it (Anton, 2026-07-26). With the
  frame both are 32pt, exactly like the clipboard rows.
- **RowActionIcon (Controls.swift) is the ONLY module-row action icon**: SF
  Symbols are not drawn to a common optical size, so at one point size a dashed
  viewfinder looked smaller than a boxed arrow and the solid eyedropper looked
  darker than both — three buttons in a row that visibly did not match (Anton,
  2026-07-26). The view carries a per-symbol size and weight table (viewfinder
  and boxed arrow 12.5, eyedropper 12 and .light) and one 24×10 tap area — or
  16×14 in `compact` mode, where the WHOLE row is the button (converter,
  archives) and a tap area of its own would only make the card taller. The
  colour is always `textSecondary`, `Theme.editing` while the action runs.
- The recognition and archive windows size themselves from their content the way
  the converter does (`screenTextContentHeight` / `archiveContentHeight` + the
  matching `adjust…Height`), and their `contentMinSize` sits BELOW the empty
  content: a floor above it is exactly what leaves a gap under the drop plate.
- **SettingChip (Controls.swift) is the ONLY chip toggle** in the entire
  app: height 28, corner radius 5, mono 10 / icon 13, padding 9,
  inactive border Theme.divider, hover hoverDim+pointer. All former
  local chips (settingChip/unitChip/themeIcon/alertMode/styleChip/
  bigToggleChip/displayStyleCard, onboarding and converter chips) are thin
  wrappers over it. A new chip = SettingChip only; copies are forbidden.
- **RowCircle + TransportCircle (Controls.swift)** are the shared leading-circle
  geometry and view for the row modules: the tracker's play/stop button and the
  to-do checkbox are ONE control at ONE visible diameter (`RowCircle.diameter`,
  18pt), each LEFT-ALIGNED (not centered) in the 22pt `RowCircle.gutter` at the
  2pt row inset, so the circle's visible edge sits exactly on the row inset line
  — the same line the module subheader and footer text start on — and the two
  circles line up on the same left column. `TransportCircle` draws a FILLED disc
  (glyph knocked out) or a BORDERED ring (an empty `systemName` = an unchecked
  box), with per-caller colors — the timer transport palette by default, muted
  tokens for the checkbox.
- **Play glyph (`PlayGlyph`, Controls.swift)** is the ONE play triangle across
  the whole app — SF's sharp `play.fill` is never used for a play control. It is
  a hand-drawn triangle whose outline is round-joined thick enough to bulge the
  corners smooth (the same technique as the status-bar running badge), with that
  outline unioned INTO the path so the glyph is filled exactly once: every ink
  token here carries opacity, and a separate fill and stroke stacked it along the
  rim — at the torrent row's secondary ink the doubled rim read as an outlined
  triangle instead of a solid one. Everything is proportional to a `box` size and
  offset right `box·0.06` for optical centering. Corner rounding is the `round` fraction of `box`, 0.46 by default
  (tuned noticeably rounder than the original 0.34, "round as much as possible",
  while still reading as a play down to the 18pt row circle); one factor scales
  sanely to every size. Call sites: the tracker/to-do transport
  (`TransportCircle`, `box = 0.38·diameter` at `round 0.36` — grown 2026-08-28
  because the glyph read as a dot at row size, and rounded LESS with it: at 0.46
  the join eats the tip and both far corners, so a bigger box only looked wider),
  the main timer button — compact 27/34pt and full 48pt,
  `box = 0.315·size` — the torrent row play control (`box 11` in the PRIMARY ink,
  the same weight the tracker transport carries, since resuming is what a stopped
  row invites; pause keeps SF `pause.fill` in the secondary ink), and the timer
  help-tab icon legend. The menu-bar badge is
  deliberately excluded (it ships with the corner-system redesign). Pause glyphs
  everywhere keep SF `pause.fill`.
- **HoverDeleteX (Controls.swift)** is the shared hover-only row delete. Both row
  modules insert it IN FLOW, only while the row is hovered, right before the
  row's trailing fixed content (the tracker's time; nothing follows it in
  to-dos) — it lives inside the row's flexible spacer, so a non-hovered row
  reserves no width and the trailing content never moves or gets covered.
- **MiniSlider's number is a FIELD, not a label** (Anton, 2026-09-12): the dial
  is dragged for a rough value and typed for an exact one, so its figure is a
  `SteadyField` like every other field in the app. Four rules make the two ways
  of setting it one control. A drag drops the caret first — a dial that moves
  under a field still holding focus commits the typed digits over the dragged
  ones on the way out. A keystroke is filtered INTO the field
  (`NumericInput.filterDigits`, ASCII digits only, no more of them than the
  range's widest number holds), because `updateNSView` leaves the text alone
  while the caret is in it: filtering the binding alone would drop the character
  from the value and leave it on the screen. The value follows the field only
  while the caret is in it and only inside the range, so a half-typed "1" on the
  way to "15" cannot jump a 10…20 dial; what falls outside is clamped on commit,
  and only if the person actually typed (an `edited` flag), so opening a field
  and leaving it cannot rewrite the value. Escape puts the number back and
  releases the caret. `NumericField` and `RateLimitField` take the same filter —
  the rejected character used to stay on screen in all three.
- **A snapshot draws the number as TEXT.** `ImageRenderer` cannot draw an
  `NSViewRepresentable` at all — it paints a yellow fill with a 🚫 where the
  view should be — so under `Snapshot.active` the dial swaps its field for a
  `Text` of the same font and width. The same reason takes the pointing hand out
  of a picture: `Theme.handCursor()` adds nothing under `Snapshot.active`,
  and until it did, every hover control in the app — chips, plates, clear
  buttons — carried that yellow 🚫 through all 22 product screenshots.
- **The pointer over a control is a hand, and stays one.** `Theme.handCursor()`
  (every `hoverHighlight` and `hoverDim` goes through it) sets the hand on each
  pointer move over the control, and again when the control is rebuilt or moved
  under a pointer that has not moved. An AppKit cursor rect was tried
  (2026-09-09) and never showed the hand: a rect counts only for the view the
  pointer hits, and the view behind the button answers no hit so the click
  reaches the button (Anton, 2026-09-15). Leaving the control puts the arrow
  back.
- **FilePicker (FilePicker.swift) is the ONLY Open and Save panel** (found
  2026-09-13): twelve places built their own `NSOpenPanel` or `NSSavePanel`, and
  ten of them had no `Snapshot.active` guard — a modal panel reached during a
  render hangs the run with nobody there to close it. The guard lives inside the
  picker now, so a new call site cannot forget it: under `Snapshot.active` an
  Open answers nothing and a Save answers nil. A view's own staging flag (the
  converter's onboarding `preview`, the app shelf's `demo`) is still the
  caller's to check.
- **DropPlate (Controls.swift) is the ONLY drop plate in a window** (Anton,
  2026-09-13): the converter, archive, recognition and uninstaller windows. Each
  had drawn its own dashed rectangle, and only the converter's took a click, so
  three plates that read as "put files here" did nothing when pressed. The plate
  is a button now: a click opens `FilePicker` with what that window takes —
  files and folders for the converter and the archive, one picture for
  recognition, one app from /Applications for the uninstaller — and hands the
  result to the same path a drop reaches. It carries the hover highlight, the
  pointing hand, a dashed border that turns solid in the accent while a drag is
  over it, and a tooltip naming the click (`tipBrowse*`, or `uninstallPick`):
  the visible text says "drop", so the tooltip is the only place the second way
  is written. Buttons inside a plate (recognition's capture and paste) keep their
  own clicks. The panel rows that take a drop (converter, archive, torrent) were
  buttons already and keep their row style; the torrent row gained its tooltip
  (`torrentAddHint`) the same day.

## Dock presence

Hop is an accessory app (`LSUIElement`, `setActivationPolicy(.accessory)`) and
has no Dock icon — which is right until it opens a window of its own. A window
that cannot be reached from the Dock has to be found through the panel every
time, and the panel is the whole app when all the user wanted back was the
converter (Anton, 2026-07-28).

- While at least one of Hop's OWN windows is open, the policy is `.regular`:
  the app takes a Dock icon, a place in Cmd-Tab and a menu bar. The icon and
  the menu bar leave with the last window (`leaveDockModeIfIdle`, driven by
  `NSWindow.willCloseNotification` — which arrives while the window still
  reports itself visible, hence the one-runloop delay before the check).
- The switch happens BEFORE the window is ordered in (`enterDockMode`, called
  ahead of every `NSApp.activate` that precedes a window). Switching after it
  is on screen makes the app blink out of focus and the window drop behind
  whatever was in front.
- Counted windows: settings, the torrent add sheet, converter, archive,
  recognition, onboarding and each Finder archive-progress window. NOT the
  panel — it hangs off the status item and closes on any outside click, so it
  belongs to the menu bar rather than the Dock. NOT the quit confirmation: it
  lives for a second and asks one question.
- A click on the Dock icon reaches the window it is there for, including a
  minimized one (`applicationShouldHandleReopen` deminiaturizes and raises).
- `showWindowsInDock` (settings → general) turns it off for people who run a
  menu-bar app precisely so that nothing appears in the Dock. ON by default. The
  row reads "show hop in the dock" over the note that already explains WHEN the
  icon appears; the old title, "windows in the dock", named the windows rather
  than the icon and read as if it were about hiding windows (Anton, 2026-09-02).
- Side effect worth knowing: in `.regular` SwiftUI supplies a real menu bar
  (Apple · Hop · Edit · View · Window · Help — verified 2026-07-28), so ⌘V in a
  window goes through the system Edit menu while one is open. The
  `ConverterPaste` monitor still handles the accessory case and stays.

## Panel and navigation

- Header: a spaces switcher on the left — one icon tab per space, click to
  switch, the active one chip-highlighted — and the service trio on the
  right: ⓘ (about), gear (settings), ⏻ (quit, with a confirmation dialog).
  **With one space the switcher is not drawn at all** (Anton, 2026-09-02): a row
  of one tab switches to nothing and only takes the header's width.
  The switcher is pure navigation: adding, reordering, renaming (icon) and
  deleting spaces all live in the settings "modules & tabs" table (the
  combined space/module table), so a stray header click can't create a
  space. Up to 4 spaces (`PanelTabsModel.maxTabs`) — the
  cap keeps 4×56pt tabs plus the trio inside the 340pt header content
  (≈338pt at the cap). Panel width 368.
- Deleting a space (in the settings table) appends its modules to the END of the
  space on its LEFT, with their visibility untouched (`PanelTabsModel.deleteTab`;
  confirm copy "its modules move to the end of the tab on its left"). It used to
  send them to the first space and hide them; a neighbour is where the eye
  expects them, and a space going away is no reason to hide what was on it
  (Anton, 2026-09-02). Deleting the first space sends them to what becomes the
  first. The last remaining space can never be deleted. The settings-table drop is resolved
  by pure, tested HopCore helpers: `SettingsDropGeometry.insertIndex` turns the
  laid-out chip frames + the drop point into an insert index (one resolver for
  both the live indicator and the commit), and `PanelTabsModel.applyDrop`
  applies it (remove-then-insert, so a drop onto a module's own slot is a no-op).
  `PanelTabsModel` is defensive against a caller-built empty model — `ensure`
  no-ops instead of indexing `tabs[0]`.
- **1.3.x → spaces migration:** upgrading from a 1.3.x build (one flat module
  order plus per-module `show*Module` toggles) into 1.4.0 spaces is one-shot on
  launch — the flat order becomes the "house" space, the system monitor and the
  tracker+to-do pair split into their own canonical spaces, and every module
  whose legacy toggle was OFF is hidden (exact seeds and
  one-shot flags in "Default spaces" below). It is idempotent: each step runs
  once behind its flag and never re-disturbs a layout the user has since
  rearranged.
- **Empty-space hint:** a space with NO visible modules (its modules dragged
  elsewhere or hidden) shows a centered `tabEmptyHint` ("empty space — move
  modules here", tertiary) in place of a blank body, so the space still reads as
  a real, fillable place rather than looking broken.
- Default spaces: a fresh install migrates into THREE spaces — "house" with
  the general modules, "display" for the system monitor (the monitor tab should
  LOOK like a monitor; was "gauge"), and "clock" for the time-management pair
  `["tracker", "todos"]`. Modules whose legacy default is hidden start hidden
  on a fresh migrate (currently the torrent module, opt-in
  before its onboarding/banner "enable" — which still activates it). A
  decoded legacy model gets its whole active layout rebuilt into that same
  three-space shape exactly once (`canonicalLayoutSeeded`): space 1 gets
  every other active module, in the order first encountered scanning the
  existing spaces, keeping space 1's current icon; space 2 gets "system"
  alone (icon "display") only if system is active; space 3 gets "tracker"
  then "todos" (icon "clock") only for whichever of the two are shown. Hidden
  flags are untouched — canonicalization only rearranges where modules sit, and
  any space beyond these three dissolves, its modules folded into space 1. This replaced three earlier one-shot seeds
  that each nudged a single module in place (`trackerTabSeeded`,
  `todosSeeded`, `systemTabSeeded`) because patching modules in one at a
  time could still leave them stacked on the wrong space depending on what
  else already occupied it. Existing users' icons/layout are otherwise
  untouched. The rebuild itself is a tested pure transform in HopCore
  (`PanelTabsModel.canonicalized()`); the app layer only guards it behind the
  one-shot flag, resets a dangling `activeSpaceID` and persists.
- **No opt-in for the new modules (1.4.0):** an upgrading 1.3.x user gets the
  new canonical layout IMMEDIATELY on first launch — the tabs rebuild at once and
  the tracker + to-dos are VISIBLE together on the clock space. There is NO
  feature/opt-in banner and no enable/hide question for them; the only
  feature-announcement banner in the app is the torrent module's own (its opt-in
  mechanics are unchanged). The user's existing off-states are preserved: any
  module hidden before the update (a monitor they turned off, torrent before
  its opt-in, anything the old bucket held) stays hidden after — only the new
  modules and the tab restructure appear automatically.
- Module-visibility migration: the old `show*Module` toggles are read once
  and every OFF module is hidden, after which visibility is the `hidden` flag
  and the toggles are never read again. The
  fresh-migrate path applies this deterministically on every recompute (so a
  module never flickers visible while `panelTabsRaw` catches up) and claims
  the `moduleVisibilityMigrated` flag; a decoded legacy model runs it once,
  behind the flag, so a later re-activation is not undone. Onboarding offers a
  per-module toggle for every module — timer, awake, clipboard, converter,
  window manager, the system monitor, the time tracker, to-dos and torrents
  (transient `@State`, not the dead `show*Module` keys) — and applies the
  choices straight to the spaces model (`activateStoredModule`/
  `deactivateStoredModule`): an enabled module stays on the canonical space the
  launch-time fresh migrate already placed it on, a disabled one is hidden
  where it stands. Because the fresh migrate always lays down all three
  canonical spaces, turning the monitor / tracker / to-dos off can empty space
  2 or 3, so `dropEmptyOnboardingSpaces` runs once right after and removes any
  space left empty (except space 1, which always stays — the speed test has no
  onboarding toggle, so it is never truly empty); the fresh install therefore
  never opens onto a blank tab. Opening a `.torrent` file or magnet link
  reactivates the torrent module the same way.
- Onboarding's module choices: ONE 3-column grid holding every module switch —
  fifteen of them, five even rows — in a 560pt-wide window (Anton, 2026-07-29;
  it was 300pt with four modules as full-width rows and the rest as a cramped
  grid of switch-above-name cells). Each cell is a name on the LEFT and the
  switch on the RIGHT, the same shape as the rows above it. Only the choices
  that are not modules stay full width, and in this order: language, theme,
  launch at login, timer format. Launch-at-login used to sit directly on top of
  the grid, where a wide row in a bigger type size read as a first column of it;
  the timer-format cards now stand between the two. Names are nouns, wrap to two lines, and their cells are TOP-aligned so a
  two-line name cannot lift its switch above its neighbours'. The torrent
  engine-size note sits under the grid and now names torrents, since it no longer
  stands beside them.
- EVERY switch starts ON, including the eyedropper, recognition, VPN and a grid
  of apps (Anton, 2026-07-29): the first screen should hand over a whole app, and
  a module nobody wants is one switch away in the same form. A grid of apps is
  the only choice with nothing to switch on — the module exists only once a grid
  does — so choosing it CREATES the first grid (empty, saying so) and places it.
- Onboarding marks EVERY what's-new announcement as seen (`featureAnnouncementIDs`),
  not a hardcoded pair. A fresh install has just answered the module question by
  name in the form, and a card in the panel asking it again is the app not
  listening; that is exactly what a newly added announcement did until this
  (Anton, 2026-07-29).
- The module grid is TWO columns, not three. At three, the gap between a switch
  and the next column's name was smaller than the gap to its own name, so the
  switch read as belonging to the wrong row.
- Settings tab order: general → modules & tabs → timer → monitor →
  remaining modules. "Remaining modules" = awake/clipboard/tracker/to-dos/converter
  as sections with headers (torrent sits at the end of the same tab). The tracker
  and to-do sections each carry a single `visible rows` row (`VisibleRowsField`:
  a numeric 3…15, default 10 — see 8.21). The window-snap block (layout picker,
  "resize windows with hotkeys" toggle, its ⌃⌥-key grid) is the LAST section on
  this tab (`windowsSettings`, after torrent) — Anton moved it here on 2026-07-21,
  reversing the 2026-07-19 move into "general": general keeps only the global
  hotkeys. The block is verbatim, including the toggle's `refreshSnapHotkeys()`
  re-registration hook.
- Torrent speed limit (8.22): the down/up limit fields (`RateLimitField`) share
  one `KB/s | MB/s` unit toggle (segmented, like the window-layout picker). The
  stored value is ALWAYS canonical KB/s (`torrentRateDownKBps`/`…Up`; 0 =
  unlimited) — the unit (`torrentRateUnit`, one shared preference) only changes
  the display: toggling reformats both fields in place, no migration. KB mode
  accepts up to 6 digits; MB mode up to 4 integer digits + one optional decimal
  (1 MB = 1000 KB, the module's decimal convention, matching the card's speed
  readout). Conversion/parse/clamp is `HopCore.RateLimit` (`RateLimitTests`). To
  make "off" legible, a ZERO value (including one the user just typed) renders in
  the tertiary/placeholder gray so it reads as inactive, while any non-zero value
  uses the normal active text color; a short tertiary caption below the row
  (`torrentRateHint`, "0 — no limit", ×18) spells it out. The semantics are
  unchanged — 0 still means unlimited; this is presentation only.
  "modules & tabs" is the combined space/module table,
  its own top-level section (a nested general/"modules & tabs" sub-tab was
  tried and rejected). The app version is shown next to the "check & update" button.
  The "latest version installed" / "failed" note after a manual check is
  transient: it clears when the settings window closes or after 30 minutes —
  a stale note would deny an update that shipped since.
  Toggles are our own MiniSwitch (the system Toggle doesn't render in
  ImageRenderer).
- Info page: per-module tabs, "term — explanation" style
  (the term is bold up to the " — "). The general-tab footer is three lines in
  ONE identical font (mono 11 — the plain connective text matches the links, so
  line heights don't jump): "open source · version X · GitHub" (GitHub a link);
  the author credit (`aboutFooter`, e.g. "made by Anton Shakirov") — the whole
  credit is itself the link to antonshakirov.com (ru → the Russian site, others
  → /en; there is no separate antonshakirov.com link) — next to the product
  landing link, in the app's language when the landing has it (8 languages),
  otherwise English. A third row is the support contact: "feedback & support ·
  hop@antonshakirov.com · telegram", the address a mailto: link opening the
  user's mail client and "telegram" a link to the support bot
  (https://t.me/HopSupportBot); both labels are proper nouns, not localized
  (like "GitHub"). Below the footer sits the donation block (see "Donation
  block").
- Donation block: the ONLY donation surface in the whole product — the landing
  and README deliberately have none, and nothing else in the app does either. It
  sits below the general-tab footer, set apart in its own faint card (chipBg,
  rounded). The WHOLE card is a single button that opens the donation link — one
  obvious place to click, with the house whole-row hover (a hoverBg lift plus the
  pointing-hand cursor). Inside, left-aligned, a title ROW — a leading filled
  heart (`heart.fill`, `Theme.iconHealth`, the house both-theme health red) then
  a bolder title (`donateTitle`, e.g. "support hop", house lowercase) — over a
  subtitle (`donateBody` — gift-framing, future-impact, e.g. "your support will
  help ship new features and keep making hop better"). The card HStack is
  TOP-aligned so the external-page glyph (`arrow.up.forward.app`, the same one
  the converter and torrent rows use, tertiary tint) rides the TITLE row at the
  top-right, not the card's vertical centre; it signals leaving the app. There is
  no separate action link.
  NO perks or rewards are ever promised (donations are gifts). Link routing
  mirrors the localized-README rule: Russian → https://web.tribute.tg/d/Nvp,
  every other locale → https://web.tribute.tg/d/Nvk. All strings are
  country/currency-neutral; the amount and any currency are Tribute's concern.
  Keys `donateTitle` and `donateBody` are translated into every language.
- Languages in pickers use the standard order, like system lists:
  alphabetical by NATIVE names, Latin → Cyrillic → CJK (pickerOrder,
  localizedCompare). FINAL per Anton 2026-07-13; the "by English names"
  variant was tried and reverted. "Same as system" sits on top; there is
  search.
- Menu bar: asterisk (brand glyph, 8 rays); on the right — a bottom badge and
  a yellow awake dot (top); on finish — a blinking bell; the countdown is
  monospaced and can be disabled in settings. The bottom badge is the timer's
  play/pause when the timer claims it; otherwise, while a task is tracking, a
  hand-drawn monochrome stopwatch badge sits there. With the countdown on
  (default) the digits are in the title and the stopwatch badge in the corner,
  so both show at once; the badge never changes the status-item width.
- **The panel is keyboard-transparent** (Anton, 2026-07-13; completed
  2026-07-15): it never steals keyboard focus — on open AND after any
  click inside it, focus goes back to the app underneath (dictation and
  Cmd+V land there). The panel is mouse-only, with four exceptions that
  do capture the keyboard: digit entry into the timer display (while a
  digit group is selected), the clipboard search field, a focused
  tracker inline field (a task name or a total-time edit), and a
  focused to-do field. The
  timer itself starts/stops ONLY via its on-screen play button — Return and
  Space do NOT toggle it (Anton, 2026-07-19). `handleKey` handles only digit
  entry, Delete (backspace a digit), Escape (deselect the digit group) and
  Return (end digit entry, same as Esc, without starting the timer).
  The tracker and to-do cases also guard the panel's global key handler: while
  such a field is open, Return commits the name/text — it must NOT reach
  `handleKey` and be swallowed by the digit editor. The capture is one flag fed
  by the timer digit editor, the clipboard search field, the tracker field and
  the to-do field (`panelKeyboardCaptured =
  editUnit != nil || trackerEditing || todosEditing || clipboardSearching`).
  When the capture ends
  (Esc/Enter/click elsewhere), focus returns to the app underneath again. Focus moving to another Hop window (settings,
  converter) is legitimate and is not overridden. Global hotkeys work
  regardless of focus.
- Right-click on the icon — a system NSMenu in sentence case:
  DYNAMIC items on top based on active state ("Stop Timer"/
  "Stop Stopwatch" during a countdown, "Turn Off No Sleep" while awake is
  active — they act without opening the panel), then Open / Settings /
  Handbook / About / Quit.
- **The menu carries the handbook and about, not only settings** (Anton,
  2026-09-03). Both open the settings window on their own page
  (`settingsSectionRequest`), and both are labelled with the SAME string the
  sidebar uses for that page — `guideTab` and `aboutTitle` — so one screen has
  one name wherever it is reached from. They sit under Settings because all three
  open the same window.
- **No empty "Hop Settings" window, and the app menu opens Hop's own windows**
  (Anton, 2026-09-17). SwiftUI demands a scene. A `Settings` placeholder is
  SHOWN by SwiftUI at every launch as an empty window titled "Hop Settings"
  (behind other apps, since Hop does not activate — it surfaces when those move
  away), and it also takes over the application menu: About, Settings (⌘,) and
  Quit (⌘Q) went to a system About card, that same empty window, and a quit
  without confirmation. The formal scene is therefore a menu bar extra that is
  never inserted — nothing to show, no second status item. The application menu
  is reachable whenever Hop is frontmost (the Dock-mode menu bar, or ⌘, / ⌘Q
  while the panel or any Hop window has focus), so its three items are replaced:
  About and Settings open the settings window (About on its own page), Quit goes
  through the same confirmation as the right-click menu. The labels are the
  right-click menu's strings, read at launch: a language switched while Hop runs
  reaches this menu with the next launch (SwiftUI does not rebuild it on a
  settings change; the system items beside them are not translated at all). In
  safe mode no model exists, so About and Settings
  do nothing and Quit quits.
- Launch at login — SMAppService.mainApp.

## Window zones

- **The zones ship as ONE row**, not the 3×6 grid (`windowsLayout` defaults to
  "row"). Somebody who had been using the grid before the key existed keeps it:
  App.swift writes "grid" once for a Mac whose onboarding is already done. The
  wizard claims the key as "row" when it finishes, so a fresh install is never
  mistaken for an upgrader on its next launch (Anton, 2026-09-06).

## Settings window

- The sidebar lists the modules in the PANEL's own order, space by space
  (`PanelView.storedModuleOrder()`), not in the registry's: a module that sits in
  the middle of space one has its page in the middle of the list, and a new one
  slots in where it belongs rather than at the end (Anton, 2026-09-06). A module
  the arrangement does not mention keeps its registry position at the tail.

## Localization

- Languages: en ru de es pt fr it zh ja nl ko th vi hi id tr pl sr ar he fa ur —
  in the order `AppLanguage` declares, which is the order the app offers them
  in; the `tables` literal need not follow it. A new UI string goes into every
  one of them at once; `--l10n-check` must pass.
  Check long languages (de, fr) for truncation.
- **The number of languages is never printed anywhere.** Not in the app, not in
  a readme heading, not on the site, not in release notes. A count is a quantity
  that goes up and down, and printing it turns the set into a story about
  languages arriving and leaving. The list of names says what is supported
  without inviting that reading.
- The set shipped is the one the app is released with, not everything that
  was ever translated. Serbian, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu joined it
  for 2.1, which is what the right-to-left machinery below is for.
- Inside the panel — brand lowercase; system surfaces (NSMenu,
  notifications) — sentence case (.capitalizedFirst).
- **No word is left hanging at the end of a line** (Anton, 2026-09-06): a short
  preposition or conjunction is joined to the word after it with a non-breaking
  space. The L10n tables carry the result and `--l10n-check` guards them; the
  README translations are prose on GitHub, outside both. Russian takes
  the full rule (every one- and two-letter preposition, conjunction and
  particle, plus the three-letter ones); the other alphabetic languages take
  their single-letter words (en a/I, es a y o e u, pt a e o à, it e a o i è,
  fr à a y, vi ở, pl w z i o a u) and Persian, Arabic and Urdu take their
  conjunction — و for the first two, and for Urdu both اور and the bare و, which
  formal Urdu keeps for pairs written in the Persian manner. Serbian takes the
  same shape as Russian and in the same script — its table is Cyrillic, so its
  list is too. The ten empty lists each have a reason of their own: German,
  Turkish and Indonesian write their short words onto the word they belong to;
  Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai do not wrap on spaces;
  Hebrew attaches its conjunction to the word itself; Hindi puts its short words
  after the noun rather than in front of it, so none of them stands at the end
  of a line waiting for the next word; and Dutch does not hold to the rule at
  all. An empty list is a decision with a reason written down, never a language
  that was passed over — the gate cannot tell the two apart on its own. Key
  chords are joined the same way (⌃ ⌥ M, ⌘ V, and the same chord behind a
  right-to-left direction mark), which is what keeps them from breaking across
  two lines; they read alike in every language, so they are joined even
  where the language has no short-word list. A language that writes without
  spaces stands the chord right against the sentence ("パネルが開き、⌃ ⌥ M") — the
  rule reads the modifiers a token ends on, and the chord starts a run of its
  own there, since the line can still break in front of the modifier. The same
  holds on the other side: the sentence past the chord's key wraps on its own,
  so its length is no part of the piece the chord makes and does not spend the
  chord's budget. The chord ends at its key, and the space after the key belongs
  to the rule like any other — a join left standing there would weld the chord
  to whatever sentence came next.
- **A particle that leans back is joined backwards** (2026-09-09): the Russian
  zhe, li, by, b, the Serbian li, bi and the Thai repetition mark hold on to the
  word before them, so a line may not start with one either. Counted among the
  short words they were glued the wrong way round, to the word after rather than
  the word before, which moved the break instead of removing it. That is why
  they are a list of their own, `L10n.trailingWords`. A particle asks only not
  to start a line, so it costs its own length rather than the length of the word
  it leans on — which is what lets it hold on to a long Thai word that has no
  space to break at.
- **The rule is code, and the check is the gate** (2026-09-09): the joining
  lives in `HangingWords` (HopCore) and the words each language counts live in
  `L10n.shortWords` and `L10n.trailingWords`, beside the tables that carry the
  result — the rule is the same everywhere, the words are data. `--l10n-check`
  fails on any table entry that `HangingWords.glued` would change, which covers
  a missing join and a join the rule would not make alike: gluing starts by
  taking apart the joins the rule owns, so a run left over from a looser reading
  has to earn its place again. A join around a word no list carries was made by
  hand and is left where it is, and a language whose lists are empty is passed
  by rather than cleared. Written by hand the rule drifted — a couple of hundred
  lines had gone back to ordinary spaces by the time it was measured. A joined
  run stops at sixteen characters: past that the piece cannot break anywhere and
  overflows a narrow column, which is worse than the hanging word it cured. A
  value put in while the app runs is never joined to, since it brings a length
  of its own — a printf conversion of any kind, the count `{n}` and the symbol
  `{sym:…}` alike, which is how "%1$@ of %2$@ files" keeps its break. Holding a
  particle back is the one exception: the word it leans on stands to its left,
  and the particle brings its own length, so what stands to the right of the
  join has no say in it. Neither is a word welded to a token that is nothing but
  punctuation: the real next word would still be free to start the line, so the
  join buys nothing. A number, an arrow or a symbol is not punctuation and joins
  like a word, and the join carries on through it, so an arrow between two words
  does not take the hang over from the preposition in front of it. The carry
  ends where the phrase does: a comma or a closing bracket stops it, and the
  word after the comma is free to start a line. A word carrying a comma is none
  of the rule's business in either direction, and a join made around one by hand
  stays — but taking joins apart reaches one step wider than making them, so a
  join an earlier reading of the rule left behind is still the rule's to remove.
  The rule is stdlib alone, with no Foundation character sets underneath it, so
  it answers the same on every build.
- **The gate holds one opinion of its own** (2026-09-09): asking only whether a
  table entry is already what the rule would leave behind cannot see a join the
  rule does not own, and a chord broken by such a join passes unnoticed. So
  `--l10n-check` also reads the text directly and fails on any modifier standing
  in front of an ordinary space, whatever the rule thinks of the line.
- **An invisible mark has work to do** (2026-09-09): a zero-width non-joiner is
  how Persian is written and stays in the tables as itself, because writing the
  1421 of them — every one in the `fa` table — as escapes would make each
  Persian string unreadable to the eye that has to proofread it. The 264
  direction marks are the other case: they steer a Latin fragment or a chord
  inside a right-to-left sentence, they are not orthography, and nothing in the
  sentence shows they are there, or turn a whole line round, so they are
  written as `\u{200E}` and `\u{200F}` escapes. That leaves the non-joiner
  invisible, so `--l10n-check` reads the built tables, where an escape and a
  raw character are the same
  thing, and starts from the language. **A line that runs left to right carries
  no invisible character at all**: nothing in English or Russian needs one, and
  a right-to-left mark dropped into an English string turns "5 + 9 = 14" into
  "14 = 9 + 5" on screen while the source reads as it always did. A line that
  runs the other way may carry four — the non-joiner, the two direction marks,
  the Arabic letter mark — and each has to do something where it stands: a
  non-joiner wants a letter beside it and nothing invisible or spacing on
  either side, a direction mark wants a Latin fragment, a number, a
  substitution or a chord within reach on one side or the other, so that both
  halves of a pair around a fragment count, or else it stands in front of
  everything strong on its line and turns that line right to left. Beside a key
  chord that is the whole of it, since what the mark holds together there is the
  chord's own order. Everywhere else the line it stands on has to hold
  right-to-left text at all: on a line of Latin and figures alone a mark turns
  nothing worth turning and only reorders the words it stands before. Anything
  else fails, which is what stops a bidirectional override, a zero-width space
  or a Hangul filler from
  being pasted into a table where neither the eye nor a search for `\u{200E}`
  would find it. The failing line names the character and the place it stands
  in, because nothing in the entry itself will show it. It reads the tables,
  not the running text, where `L10n.fill` still wraps a substituted value in
  its own isolates. It found one direction mark standing before a Hebrew word,
  where it steered nothing, and it was removed. Every one of the 264 that
  stayed was measured by taking it out and drawing the line again: all 264
  change what is drawn.
- **A path keeps its opening slash** (measured 2026-09-09): a `/` is neutral,
  and one standing between a right-to-left word and a Latin path takes the
  paragraph's own direction rather than the path's (UAX#9 N2). In all four
  tables `/var/db/receipts` therefore drew as "var/db/receipts/", turning an
  absolute path into a relative one at the only place a reader would go looking
  for it. A `\u{200E}` in front of the slash holds the path together. The whole
  class was swept: every path and version island in ar, he, fa and ur was drawn
  and read back, and these four entries were the only ones that came apart.
- **A line takes its direction from its first strong letter** (measured
  2026-09-09): `hopLayoutDirection()` turns the interface round, not the
  paragraph. SwiftUI lays each line out from the first strong letter in it
  (UAX#9 P2/P3), so a line opening on a Latin word reads left to right inside
  an Arabic panel and the right-to-left words after it are pushed to the wrong
  end. Rendering the tables through `ImageRenderer` and reading the glyph order
  back through CoreText found lines like that all through ar, he, fa and ur,
  opening on "vpn", "hop", "cpu", "zip · rar", "md ← pdf", "HEVC". Take the
  marks out of the four tables today and the same rule counts 164 such lines,
  in 122 entries, across 51 distinct keys. A `\u{200F}` in front of that first
  word turns the line back; the same measurement then put a `\u{200E}` in front
  of every Latin fragment the turned line pulls apart, and took out every mark
  that changed nothing on screen. 92 marks became 264. So `--l10n-check` holds
  a second opinion of its own: **every line that carries a right-to-left letter
  opens right to left**, with `{n}`, `{sym:…}` and every printf token counted
  as neutral — `%@` and `%1$@`, but `%%`, `%.1f` and `%2$04X` too, since
  direction takes any of them as one piece whether or not the app ever fills
  one, and what they stand for carries its own direction. A line with no
  right-to-left letter in it — a unit like "Kbps", a folder named
  "Downloads" — has nothing to turn and is left
  alone; a mark there would print "cpu %" as "% cpu", and the check that looks
  for stray marks refuses one, so the two halves of the gate ask for the same
  thing. The version and date at the head of the release notes is such a line,
  and carries no mark in any of the four, so all four print the version first.
  The rule is plain Unicode, no CoreText, and was checked against CoreText on
  all 4440 lines of the four tables (re-measured 2026-09-09): they agree on
  every one. CoreText has to be asked about the line as it is drawn rather than
  as it is written, though. Ask it about the raw table text and it disagrees on
  69 lines, every one of them opening on a `{sym:…}`, whose letters it reads as
  a Latin word — but a symbol is an image by the time anything is drawn, and
  none of those 69 lines is wrong on screen. What the gate still cannot see is
  the other half of the job, a Latin fragment torn apart inside a line, because
  every cheap test
  for it asks for marks nobody needs — in front of "tar.gz", say. That half is
  measured, not gated. A substitution typed wrong is read as the characters it
  is made of, by the code that fills it and by the check that reads the tables
  alike, which is also what makes "50 % of" safe; the sixth condition below
  catches one a translator dropped or renumbered, but not one the English entry
  and its translations already share. Nor does anything compare an entry with
  the call that fills it: put a `%3$@` into an English string that is called
  with two values and every table will follow it, the gate will stay green, and
  `%3$@` will print itself on screen.
- **One form of address per language**, the one that already dominates its table
  (measured 2026-09-06): ru, es, pt and fr are polite; de, it and nl are
  familiar. A new string follows its language's form rather than the English
  original's.

### Right to left

- The language is picked in-app, not through the system locale, so SwiftUI
  never learns the direction on its own: `layoutDirection` comes from the
  process locale, which stays left-to-right. Every window, panel and
  popover root therefore calls `hopLayoutDirection()` (LayoutDirection.swift),
  which reads the setting through `@AppStorage` and flips live. AppKit
  surfaces do not see that environment — the right-click menus set
  `applyHopLayoutDirection()` separately.
- `Theme.mono` drops the monospaced design for these languages and returns
  the proportional system face with monospaced digits. A fixed-width cell
  per glyph pulls a cursive script apart; digits still hold their column,
  so the timer does not jitter. Urdu renders in SF Arabic (naskh), which
  is what every system app on macOS does — nastaliq is not a system face.
- Directional glyphs use the direction-aware SF Symbols (`chevron.backward`,
  `chevron.forward`), never `chevron.left`/`chevron.right`. The tab
  disclosure chevron rotates the opposite way in RTL, since the chevron
  itself has already flipped.
- Canvas drawings do NOT mirror: the dot-matrix digits, the monitor graphs
  and the window-snap glyphs keep their geometry, which is correct — a snap
  glyph is a map of the physical screen, and the left half stays on the
  left. Only the order of the buttons in the row follows the writing
  direction.
- Values substituted into a translated sentence (a file name, "5.1 GB", a
  version number) go through `L10n.fill`, which wraps them in Unicode
  isolates. Without that the sentence drags neighbouring punctuation to the
  wrong end of the value. A sentence that takes more than one value — the
  torrent sheet's "%1$@ needed · %2$@ free" — goes through the same call with
  the values in the order the sentence numbers them, and a value glued on
  outside a sentence through `L10n.isolate`. Substituting a value by hand is
  what put "1.2 GB" at the head of that line in fa and ur and turned the whole
  line round (found 2026-09-09). The mechanism itself lives in
  `HopCore/Substitutions.swift` so that it can be tested — `L10n` sits in the
  executable target, which has no tests — and `L10n.fill` is a call through to
  it. Three rules hold there, each one a defect that was measured rather than
  imagined: **a substitution written wrong prints itself**, since a parser that
  reads a place number and then finds no `$@` must give back the figures it
  read rather than swallow them, and "~%80" in the Turkish table is a per cent
  sign, not a place number; **a place number is written in plain figures
  only**, so that a `%\u{0661}$@` counts as a substitution to both the gate
  reading the table and the code filling it, or to neither; and **a value has
  the direction controls taken out of it before it is fenced in**, because a
  value carrying U+2069 closes our own isolate and whatever override follows it
  then reorders the sentence it was meant to sit inside.
- **A name that comes from outside is fenced before it is drawn** (2026-09-09).
  A name written by somebody else may carry a right-to-left override:
  `invoice\u{202E}fdp.exe` draws as `invoiceexe.pdf`, so the extension the
  reader decides by is not the extension the file has. Measured through
  CoreText, not argued: fenced, the same name draws as `invoicefdp.exe`. Every
  such name goes through `Substitutions.isolate` where it is drawn — the
  torrent name and the files inside it, the files dropped on the converter and
  the archiver, the folder each of those writes into, a line of the clipboard,
  an app on a shelf and the shelf's own name, a VPN profile named by whichever
  app installed it, and every name, bundle identifier and path in the
  uninstaller, which is the one window where a name that draws wrong sends a
  file to the trash. `isolate` strips U+202A–U+202E and U+2066–U+2069 and
  folds every line break in it to a space, and fences what is left, so a name
  can only ever reorder itself. Each of the three carries weight. Stripping the
  whole isolate range matters, not just the closing one: an initiator the name
  leaves open eats our own closer and the fence runs to the end of the line.
  Folding the line breaks matters because an isolate ends where a paragraph
  does: measured through CoreText, `(⁨a\u{2029}אבג⁩)` paints our own closing
  bracket to the *left* of the name, outside a fence the name walked out of.
  A direction mark — U+200E, U+200F, U+061C — is left in, because inside the
  fence it does no more than a Hebrew letter would.
- Fencing happens on the way to the screen and nowhere else: what is stored,
  compared, written to disk and used to pick a converter stays the name the
  file actually has. The one place a name is cleaned earlier is a name **Hop
  itself creates**: a page's `<title>` and a converted file's own name both
  become a file the converter writes, so `HTMLConversion.outputName` takes the
  direction controls out — from a title along with the characters a file name
  cannot hold, from a file's own name and nothing else, since that name is
  already the user's. Otherwise Hop would put a name on disk that draws as
  another name. `ClipboardDocument.fileName` already dropped them with the
  rest of the format characters.
- A name of nothing but direction controls is left empty by the stripping, and
  a caller that asked the raw name whether it was empty then drew a blank
  where its own label belonged. Wherever a name has something to fall back to
  — the shelf's label, the sheet's heading, the default notification title,
  the whole path behind a missing bundle identifier, the `…` of a folder chip
  — the fence is asked instead: `Substitutions.isolate(_:or:)` tests what it
  is about to draw, not what it was handed, and trims it so the two answers
  cannot differ. Where nothing can stand in — a file row, an app name, a trace
  path — a name that empties itself draws empty, as it did before it was
  fenced.
- A notification title is one line: `Alerts.oneLine` folds its line breaks and
  capitalizes the first letter the reader can actually see rather than the
  fence in front of it. Every title goes through it, the reminder scheduler's
  included — it posts its own notifications and had kept its own
  capitalization. The body is left as it came: nothing of ours is drawn after
  it, so a note keeps the shape it was written in.
- **What an outside process writes counts as outside** (2026-09-09). A task's
  text and a tracker project's name look typed in Hop, and mostly are, but
  `agent-commands.json` and the registered `hop://` scheme both reach
  `todo.add` and `tracker.start`, so a page can name a task. They are fenced
  where they are drawn, the reminder's notification title included.
- What an extractor names a file is left alone: `ArchiveController` moves an
  entry out under the name the archive gave it, the way Archive Utility and
  The Unarchiver do. The defence there is the fence in the archiver's own
  window, not a rename the user did not ask for.
- What is NOT held: this rule has no gate. Nothing fails a build when the next
  view draws a name raw, and the sweep of 2026-09-09 missed six places on its
  first pass — the file branch of the converter's row name, the torrent sheet's
  own heading, the uninstaller entirely, three folder chips, the VPN rows and a
  tooltip — each found by reading, not by a check. The second pass then found
  a defect the first had introduced: five places testing one string and
  drawing another, and three folder chips where the guard that had tested the
  path for emptiness was folded into the fence — which never fired, because
  `URL(fileURLWithPath: "")` resolves to the current directory and its last
  component is a real folder name. The third pass then found the fence itself
  escapable — every one of the sites above, through a character none of the
  three earlier passes had thought to try. A rule kept by attention alone is
  kept until it is not.
- **A translation carries the same substitutions as the English it translates**
  (2026-09-09): a sixth condition of `--l10n-check`. A dropped `%2$@` prints
  nothing where a figure belongs, a renumbered one prints itself, and neither
  shows up in a build or a test — the sentence is only wrong on screen, in a
  language the person shipping it does not read. So the gate lists the
  substitutions in each English entry and asks the other twenty-one for the
  same list, in any order, counting `%@`, `%1$@`, `{n}` and `{sym:…}`. Order is
  free, count is not: a sentence that asks for a value twice and a translation
  that gives it once are not the same sentence, so a repeat has to be matched
  by a repeat. What counts as a substitution here is exactly what
  `Substitutions.fill` puts a value into — `%1@` and `%0$@` are read as
  characters by both — so the check and the code can never disagree about what
  a table carries. All 732 keys pass in every language today; the check is
  there for the next translation.
- The menu-bar icon is NOT mirrored: the bar itself stays in the system's
  direction, and the badge corners are documented positions, not text.

- Copy style: lively, no officialese and no literalism ("the Mac keeps
  counting" — bad; "lets you close the lid without shutting the Mac
  down" — good).

## Intel Macs (universal build)

- Everything shipped is a UNIVERSAL binary (`swift build --arch arm64 --arch
  x86_64`, taken from `.build/apple/Products/<Config>/Hop`). An arm64-only build
  does not launch on an Intel Mac at all — Rosetta translates the other way — and
  that is the ONLY reason Hop did not run there: the whole tree compiles for
  x86_64 unchanged. A `--dev` bundle stays single-architecture, since doubling
  the wait to look at a change buys nothing.
- **Shipped as two single-architecture builds, not one universal bundle.** The
  universal binary is built once and `lipo`-thinned into `dist/arm64/Hop.app` and
  `dist/x86_64/Hop.app`, each re-signed, each with its own zip and DMG. Both stay
  15 MB — the size Hop has always been — instead of one 29 MB download carrying a
  slice the machine cannot run (Anton, 2026-07-29). Both bundled helpers (the
  torrent engine, the 7-Zip archiver) have been universal all along.
- `latest.json` carries `zip`/`sig` (arm64, the historical names, so every client
  from before 1.7.0 keeps updating) plus `zipIntel`/`sigIntel`. The updater picks
  by the RUNNING process's architecture (`#if arch(x86_64)`), not by the
  hardware, and falls back to the plain pair when the Intel keys are missing.
- The landing offers the two downloads as TWO BUTTONS side by side — the white
  one is Apple Silicon, the outlined one Intel (Anton, 2026-07-29, after the
  Intel build was tested on real hardware). Both ship in every release and update
  through the same manifest; the processor is the only thing that tells them
  apart, so neither is a footnote. They COUNT TOGETHER: one Metrika goal
  (`hop_download`) with the architecture as a parameter. The install counter
  is unaffected either way: it counts update pings, which carry the version and
  nothing else.
- `Casks/hop.rb` in the tap gains its `on_arm` / `on_intel` pair from
  `release.sh`, which REGENERATES that whole head — version and both blocks — out
  of the images it has just built and hashed. Never patched line by line and
  never `sha256 :no_check`: a checksum that is not the file's is worse than no
  Intel block at all, since Homebrew then accepts whatever the URL serves, while
  a missing block simply refuses to install on Intel. Until the first release
  that ships an Intel image, the cask keeps its single pinned build. The tap had
  also silently sat at 1.5.1 while 1.6.0 was already downloading from the site,
  which is why the version is written here rather than by hand.
- **Temperatures** are the one thing that reads differently. Apple Silicon
  publishes sensors through `IOHIDEventSystemClient`; an Intel Mac publishes none
  there and keeps its thermometers behind the SMC. `SMCTemperatureReader` is a
  read-only client for it (open `AppleSMC`, ask a key's type and size, decode
  `sp78` / `flt` / `ui8`), and `TemperatureReader` picks the source by ASKING:
  HID first, SMC only when HID returns nothing. Not by architecture — a Mac that
  answers through neither then reads nil instead of taking a branch that cannot
  work. Verified on Apple Silicon, where the SMC path also answers for the keys
  that exist there (`TH0x`, `TB0T`, `Ts0P`), which is what proves the struct
  layout and the decoding are right.
- The rule for anything else that turns out to be Apple-Silicon-only: replace it
  where there is a replacement, and otherwise do not offer it on that Mac at all
  (Anton, 2026-07-29) — a row that can never have a value is worse than a row
  that is not there.
- `Hop --sensors` dumps both sources, each line labelled `hid` or `smc`. On an
  unfamiliar Mac the question is always which thermometer answered.

### Uninstaller (1.7.0)

Removes an app AND the dozen places it leaves things behind. A row in the panel
opens its own window, the way the converter and the archives do; apps arrive by
drag-and-drop onto that window or through a "+" that opens Finder.

- **It LISTS folders and matches entries, it does not guess paths.** The first
  cut built exact paths from the bundle identifier and found two of Telegram's ten
  traces — 2 GB of 28 GB — because the rest are shaped differently:
  `Containers/<id>.<extension>` for a share extension,
  `Group Containers/<TEAMID>.<id>`, `Application Scripts/<id>`,
  `Caches/<id>.ShipIt` for a Squirrel updater (measured 2026-07-30). The folders
  scanned are `~/Library/{Application Support, Caches, Preferences, Containers,
  Group Containers, Application Scripts, Saved Application State, HTTPStorages,
  WebKit, Logs, Cookies, LaunchAgents}` and — behind one admin prompt —
  `/Library/{Application Support, Preferences, LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons,
  PrivilegedHelperTools}`.
- **An entry matches on a DOT boundary**: equal to the id, `id.`-prefixed,
  `.id`-suffixed (a team prefix), or `.id.` inside. That is what catches the four
  real shapes above while `com.acme.notesuite` is never swept up with
  `com.acme.notes`. File types (`.plist`, `.savedState`, `.binarycookies`) come off
  before comparing.
- **Three grades of match, and only two are ticked.** The identifier and the app's
  EXACT name are ticked — an app's `Application Support/<its name>` is where its
  gigabytes live, and leaving it unticked made the default run a half-uninstall. A
  name PREFIX (`Telegram Desktop` for `Telegram`) is listed unticked: often the
  same app, sometimes another one. A VENDOR folder (`Application Support/Google`
  when removing Chrome) is never ticked and always labelled — removing it takes
  Drive's data too, which is the classic uninstaller bug.
- launchd folders are stricter: only a `.plist` whose label matches the identifier
  counts, since a label is not a display name.
- **Everything goes to the TRASH, never `rm`.** The action stays reversible until
  the user empties it, which is the difference between a tool and a story about a
  tool. `FileManager.trashItem` for user-level items; the admin sweep moves its
  files into `~/.Trash` in ONE authorised step rather than deleting them.
- **The app is quit first** (`NSRunningApplication.terminate()`), and its launch
  agents are booted out (`launchctl bootout`) before their plists move — otherwise
  launchd writes them back a second later. An app that refuses to quit stops the
  run with that reason, rather than half-removing it.
- **Also scanned, found by checking a real disk** (2026-07-30):
  `Preferences/ByHost/<id>.<hardware uuid>.plist` — the reason a reinstalled app
  remembers a setting nobody expected; `Autosave Information`;
  `Logs/DiagnosticReports/<Name>_*.ips` crash reports; `/Users/Shared/<Name>`;
  `/Library/Caches`; and `/var/db/receipts/<id>.{bom,plist}`.
- **Receipts are REMOVED, not excused.** They were listed as an unremovable
  remainder until Anton asked why (2026-07-30) — and there was no reason: they are
  ordinary files behind the same admin prompt as the rest.
- **The report says what genuinely stays**, and only that: the Spotlight index (a
  database macOS maintains — it forgets a deleted file by itself in seconds, and
  `mdutil -E` would re-index the whole disk for hours to achieve nothing), unified
  logging's ring buffers (crash reports ARE per-app and are removed; the rest
  cannot be picked apart), keychain items (removable through the Security
  framework, deliberately not touched: the match is on a service name the app
  chose, and a wrong guess costs somebody a password), and system/network
  extensions with VPN profiles (the system unloads those through its own prompt).
  Claiming "not a single trace left" without that list is the lie the category is
  known for.
- The matching rules live in `HopCore.AppUninstall` and are unit-tested: the
  scanning and trashing is a thin AppKit layer over pure decisions.

### Two jobs, named in the panel

The module's row is TWO buttons — "remove the app" and "clear the cache" — each
opening the window straight into that job. One row that opened a window with tabs
inside meant you could not tell what you were about to do until it was open
(Anton, 2026-07-30). The window's title follows the job. The second is named
after what it mostly does rather than after the whole screen: "clean up" said
nothing about what would be cleaned, and the caches are why anybody opens it
(Anton, 2026-07-30).

- **Remove the app**: the drop plate AND a list of every app in /Applications and
  ~/Applications, so removing one is a click, not only a drag. The whole screen
  is ONE scroll — the plate scrolls up with the list rather than sitting above a
  list that scrolls inside it — and the window opens tall for it.
  - **Every app carries its size**, as a total with its NAMED parts beside it:
    `1.4 GB (1.2 GB app + 200 MB data)` — the bundle plus everything of its
    elsewhere. The second word is "data", never "cache": it counts application
    support, the container, preferences, logs and the cache together, and calling
    that lot a cache would make removing it sound harmless (Anton, 2026-07-30),
    because "how much do I get back" and "how much of that is the app" are two
    questions (Anton, 2026-07-30). Weighed AFTER the list is on screen, one app
    at a time, off the main thread: adding up /Applications on a Mac with a
    design suite takes seconds, and a list nobody can see yet is not worth
    waiting for. Until an app is weighed its row shows its identifier.
  - **Sorted by name or by size** (`uninstallAppSort`, remembered). A list of a
    hundred apps only answers "what should go" when the big ones can come first.
- **Clear the cache** is one screen with five sections, because they are one
  intention:
  - **caches by app**, built from the cache FOLDERS rather than the list of apps,
    so an identifier whose app is gone still shows up. The section heading says
    what the rows are, and the row itself carries only a name and a size: the
    same sentence repeated under every row was noise (Anton, 2026-07-31).
    Apple's own caches are skipped and anything under a megabyte is noise. Four
    places are read, not one: `~/Library/Caches/<id>`, a container's
    `Data/Library/Caches`, a group container's own `Library/Caches`, and the
    same folder one level inside a group container — sandboxed apps put their
    cache in whichever of those their own layout uses.
  - **installers** — folded in here rather than being a screen of its own, which is
    one screen too many for something this obvious (Anton, 2026-07-30).
  - **leftovers of apps long gone** — found automatically, which is the whole
    point: nobody remembers what they uninstalled two years ago. An identifier is
    a leftover when no installed app answers to it AND no installed app OWNS it —
    a dot-anchored prefix either way, because `com.foo.App.Updater` looks orphaned
    while its owner sits in /Applications. Five more guards keep live apps out,
    every one of them written after a real list on Anton's Mac offered eight rows
    of which seven belonged to something installed (2026-07-31):
    - **The container wrapper comes off first.** A group container is called
      `group.com.foo.App` (Podcasts writes `groups.`, with an s) and belongs to
      `com.foo.App`. Matching the raw name made Apple's own containers look
      orphaned and offered the rules file of an installed ad blocker.
    - **The same vendor is not a leftover.** `com.google.GoogleUpdater` is what
      keeps an installed Chrome up to date, and `com.openai.chat` is what an
      installed app wrote before it changed its identifier. Two shared
      components of an identifier count as one vendor. This hides a genuine
      leftover whose vendor still has something installed, and that is the trade:
      a leftover left alone costs disk space, a live app's data costs the work
      in it.
    - **Apps one folder deep count as installed.** `/Applications` is not flat:
      Adobe installs into `/Applications/Adobe Premiere Pro 2026/` and DaVinci
      Resolve into a folder of its own, and reading only the top level marked
      every one of them as uninstalled.
    - **macOS under its historic names** — Shortcuts still writes as
      `is.workflow`, the TV app as `tvappservices`, Game Center as
      `games.my.gcshowcase`, and Apple's own team identifier prefixes the
      containers it ships. None of them answer to `com.apple` and none has an app
      to vouch for them.
    - **A job launchd is running has an owner** whatever the dates say. Chrome's
      updater writes rarely enough to look abandoned while its agent sits in
      `launchctl list`.

    Nothing written to in the last 30 days is offered: something is still using
    it. The 30 days belong to the identifier and not to the folder — ChatGPT's
    preferences were three weeks old while its `HTTPStorages` folder had not been
    touched since May, and testing each folder on its own offered half of a live
    app's data. Every place one identifier was found is weighed and removed
    together.
  - **big app data we do not touch** — a list with no tick and no button, only a
    name and a size. It answers the question the cache list provokes: Telegram
    holds 23 GB and never appears among the caches, because its `Library/Caches`
    is EMPTY — the media sits in its own database inside the group container,
    cache and account data in one folder. Anything over a gigabyte in a container
    or group container is named here, with the note that only the app's own
    cleanup knows which half is disposable (Anton, 2026-07-30).
  - **the trash**, with its size and the one irreversible button in the module.
    The note under it explaining that much was dropped (Anton, 2026-07-31): the
    button is red, it says "empty the trash", and a line of small print under
    every section is what makes a window tiring to read.

  Every section with ticks carries **one tick for the whole section**, at the
  BOTTOM LEFT: a list of forty apps holding a cache is a list nobody ticks forty
  times (Anton, 2026-07-30), and the second click clears the lot again. Its box
  sits in the same column as every other box in the list and on the same line as
  the button it feeds; at the top right it was a stray control above the ticks it
  belonged to. Sections are 28pt apart, because a section ending in a button and
  the next one opening with a tick read as one row at 16.

  **The window opens before the scan does.** Walking every cache folder, every
  container and the trash, adding up sizes as it goes, takes seconds on a full
  Mac — and doing that first meant clicking the button and staring at nothing
  (Anton, 2026-07-30). The walk runs off the main thread and each list lands as
  it is ready: installers first because they are instant, then caches, the trash,
  the leftovers, and the containers last because they are the slowest thing here.
  A line at the top says the disk is still being read, and no section claims to
  be empty until it has actually been looked at.

### A release's first screen

- **Onboarding lists EVERY module, the uninstaller included** — the list is
  `ModuleCatalog` in panel order plus "apps" (a grid of apps is not a registry
  module: it exists only once a grid does), every switch on, so a module added
  later appears on the first screen with no second list to update. It marks every
  what's-new announcement seen on the way out: a fresh install has just been
  asked about all of them by name, so greeting it with a card offering the same
  modules asks a question it already answered (Anton, 2026-07-29, restated
  2026-07-30).
- **Someone who UPDATES gets the card instead.** 1.7.0 announces `modules170`
  with the uninstaller in it, and the module ships hidden until it is ticked
  there — nothing appears in a panel that was not asked for.
- The one-shot that hides a new module is keyed PER
  RELEASE (`optInModulesSeeded170`). The original key was claimed in 1.5.0, so
  reusing it would have let 1.7.0's module land in everyone's panel unasked.
- `--feature-banner-latest` renders whatever the newest card is, so it can be
  reviewed without knowing its id.
- **A release also gets a card that only tells** (`newsBanner`, `--news-banner`,
  Anton 2026-08-30). The announcement above asks whether to switch new MODULES
  on, so a release that only deepened the modules already there announced itself
  nowhere: 1.9.0 brought projects and history to the tracker, platform presets to
  the converter, mkv and webm, and the iWork batches, and the only place that
  said so was the "what's new" text, behind a window nobody opens. The card
  sits on the same chrome surface, headed `new · Hop <release>` (the version is a
  literal, never translated), and carries a line per thing the release brought,
  ×10. `what's new` opens the settings window ON its about page — the full notes
  are already written and already translated, so the card summarises rather than
  repeats; `got it` only dismisses. Reaching a particular page needed
  `settingsSectionRequest` on the model, consumed once by the window, because the
  window remembers the page it was left on.

  **A card whose release asks something of the user goes where that is done**
  (Anton, 2026-09-03). The button carries the card's own `destination` and label
  instead of always being "what's new" → updates: 1.10 cleared everybody's
  permissions, so its button says `grant access` and lands on the permissions
  page. Every other card keeps the notes as its destination.

  **A card's lines name what improved, never by how much** (Anton, 2026-08-30).
  The first cut of the vpn line read "changes colour at once instead of half a
  minute later", which advertises how bad the old behaviour was and invites the
  reader to ask why it was ever built that way. It says the connection's state
  syncs faster and the dot follows it, and no release card quotes a before-figure
  again.

  **A card is WRITTEN per release, not derived from the version.** That is what
  makes "only the second number earns a card" true without a rule in the code: a
  fix rolled out on top of a release simply gets no card, so there is nothing to
  suppress, and `ReleaseNews.Version` parses the third number only to drop it —
  1.9.1 is still the 1.9 card. `HopCore.ReleaseNews` (`ReleaseNewsTests`) picks
  the NEWEST card at or below the running version, never a queue of them:
  somebody who skipped a release wants to know where the app stands, not to
  dismiss its history one card at a time. The ones it passes over are `overtaken`
  and marked seen so they cannot surface later.

  **It leaves on whichever limit runs out first:** the button, two panel openings
  that drew it, or two days from the first one that did. The two-day clock exists
  for somebody who neither reads nor dismisses it, who would otherwise carry the
  card at the top of the panel for the rest of the release. A showing is counted
  on the way OUT rather than in, because counting on the way in can push the card
  past its limit while it is still on screen, and a banner that vanishes mid-read
  is worse than one shown once too often.

  The 1.9 card ships in 1.9.1 and reaches EVERYONE, including people already on
  1.9.0: a banner can only travel by update, and nobody has seen this one
  (Anton, 2026-08-30). It never greets a fresh install — onboarding marks the
  release cards seen alongside the announcements (`releaseCardIDs`). It also
  never shares the panel with a module announcement: that one asks a question and
  this one only tells, so the question goes first and the news waits for the next
  open.

### Tooltips

- **Every control that does something says what it does, on hover.** Icon-only
  controls are unreadable without it, and a label that truncates is only half a
  sentence — so the settings switches carry one too (Anton, 2026-07-30).
- The shared controls take it as a parameter rather than leaving it to each call
  site: `HoverIconButton`, `HoverDeleteX` and `NumericField` all accept `help`,
  and `switchSetting` attaches the row's own label.
- **A tooltip follows the STATE, not only the control.** The transport says
  "start", "pause" or "resume" depending on what the next press does; reset says
  the time it returns to; the stash button says the time it brings back; ±5 says
  which way it goes; and the digits say how they are edited AND what they read
  right now — a time set by dragging or typing has to be as legible on hover as a
  preset is (Anton, 2026-07-30).
- **A tooltip says what THIS control does, with its own numbers in it.** A
  preset reads "set the timer to 90 min", a cycle template "work 25 min, rest 5
  min, 4 rounds", a keep-awake or keyboard-lock chip "lock the keyboard for 15
  min" — and ∞ gets a sentence of its own ("until you stop it"). A generic "a
  preset" tooltip on a row of bare figures explains nothing (Anton, 2026-07-30).
- **They appear after one second** (`NSInitialToolTipDelay`, registered at
  launch). The system's own couple of seconds arrives after the pointer has moved
  on; a third of a second fires while the pointer is only passing through, which
  reads as twitchy — Anton tried both (2026-07-30).

### Uninstaller: the other two modes

- **Clear the cache, keep the app.** Only folders macOS itself calls a cache —
  `~/Library/Caches/<id>` and `Containers/<id>/Data/Library/Caches` — because the
  system may empty those at any moment, so an app that cannot survive it is
  already broken. A container or GROUP container is never cleared from outside: it
  holds the cache AND the data in one folder (Telegram's is 25 GB of media cache
  mixed with the account database, and removing it logs somebody out). Those are
  listed with their size and the note that only the app's own cleanup can go in
  there.
- **Installers** (`HopCore.InstallerFiles`): `.dmg`, `.pkg`, `.mpkg` at the TOP
  level of Downloads, Desktop and Documents. Deliberately narrow — an `.iso` may be
  a film and a `.zip` may be a year of work — and NOTHING is ticked by default: an
  installer on disk is somebody's choice, and a tool that pre-ticks them all
  eventually deletes the one that mattered. Size and date are shown so the person
  can decide.
- **The identifier is recovered when the app is already gone.** Most people drag
  the app to the Trash first, and without its Info.plist only name matches work: a
  run then found 13 traces where 22 were waiting (measured 2026-07-30). Two ways
  back — the bundle sitting in `~/.Trash/<Name>.app`, and the leftovers that spell
  the id out themselves (`ru.keepcoder.Telegram.plist` ends with the app's name;
  separators and case are ignored, so `com.x.hop-uninstall-test` matches "Hop
  Uninstall Test"). If two entries imply DIFFERENT ids, nothing is inferred: two
  apps sharing a name is exactly when guessing removes a stranger's data.
- **The cache Hop already made is thrown away once.** Setting the shared cache to
  zero stops new files; it does not remove the ones a previous version wrote. So
  the first launch of a build carrying this deletes `Cache.db`, its `-shm`/`-wal`
  and `fsCachedData` from Hop's own cache folder and records that it did
  (`httpCacheDropped`). Our own folder, so nothing is asked of anybody — "we keep
  no cache" has to mean the same thing for an update as for a fresh install
  (Anton, 2026-07-30).
- **Hop keeps no HTTP cache of its own.** It never asked for one: macOS hands
  every app a URL cache, and Hop's few downloads — the update check, the speed
  test, the 7-Zip helper — left megabytes of write-ahead log in
  `~/Library/Caches/<id>/Cache.db` that nothing ever reads again. Anton found Hop
  in its own cache list and asked what could possibly be in there (2026-07-30);
  the honest answer was "nothing of yours, and nothing we use". `URLCache.shared`
  is set to zero on both memory and disk at launch: a one-shot download gains
  nothing from being cached, and a speed test served from a cache would measure
  the wrong thing.
- **Containers, autosaved data and cookies need Full Disk Access.** macOS refuses
  even `mv` on them, so they are reported apart from real failures, with a button
  that opens the right pane of System Settings. Without it the score stops at 28
  of 31 seeded traces; with it, at 31.

### Measured against CleanMyMac (2026-07-30)

On the same fixture app, seeded with 31 traces: CleanMyMac removed 9 (the bundle,
Application Support by id and by name, Caches including the `.ShipIt` one,
Preferences, Saved Application State, Logs, one CrashReporter report) and left 22 —
containers, group container, Application Scripts, HTTPStorages, WebKit, ByHost
preferences, the launch agent, the DiagnosticReports crash log, autosaved data and
all eleven plug-in locations. Hop's scan finds 30 of the 30 seedable ones and moves
28 of them (the three protected paths need Full Disk Access). Caveat kept
deliberately: the fixture was never launched or registered, so a tool leaning on
its own database of known apps may do better on real software than it did here.

### The converter and the archives in one row (setting)

- Both are the same shape of thing — a row that opens a window and takes files —
  and on a crowded space they cost two lines for very little. `toolsOneRow` (off
  by default) draws them as ONE row split in equal parts.
- **The uninstaller is NOT part of it.** Its row is already two named buttons
  ("remove the app", "clear the cache"), so folding it in would either drop one of
  them or crowd four things into a line built for two (Anton, 2026-07-30). It
  keeps its own row whatever this setting says.
- Each part is an icon and a SINGLE word ("converter", "archives"). The full names
  do not fit side by side on a 340pt row in any language, least of all in German;
  they stay in the tooltip and in settings.
- The row is drawn where the FIRST of the two sits in that space's order, and the
  other drops out of the drawn list. Nothing is stored: the spaces model keeps
  holding the real module keys, so switching the setting back changes nothing
  else, and a space with only one of them shows that one as a normal module row.
- The collapsed row has no "move to / hide" context menu: it stands for two
  modules at once, so the menu would be lying about what it moves.

### Scoring the uninstaller (`scripts/make-uninstall-target.sh`)

- Creates a harmless app in /Applications (`Hop Uninstall Test`, its executable a
  shell script that exits) and seeds a file in EVERY place the uninstaller
  scans — 31 user-level ones, plus 14 system-level ones with `--system`.
- `--check` prints what is still on disk and the score. That is the referee for
  comparing tools: seed, let ANY uninstaller remove the app, then `--check`
  reports exactly which of the known traces survived. Neither tool's own report is
  trusted, and reading the other tool's UI is not needed (Anton's question, 2026-07-30:
  otherwise we could never learn what a competitor erases and we do not).
- Two folders cannot be seeded or read without Full Disk Access
  (`~/Library/Cookies`, `~/Library/Autosave Information`); the script names them
  and leaves them out of the score instead of dying halfway.
- Hop finds 30 of the 30 seedable user-level traces (measured 2026-07-30). The
  gaps that measurement itself exposed — `.wdgt`, `.colorPicker` and `.app`
  bundle suffixes — were fixed the same day.

## Tooltips

- Every ICON-ONLY control carries a tooltip naming what it does (Anton,
  2026-07-29): the header trio, copy and paste in the clipboard, its expand and
  clear-search icons, the note mark on a to-do, the tracker's play and stop, the
  timer's presets, ±5, restore, play/pause and mode toggle, the ten-plus window
  zones by name, keep-awake durations, the speed test's rerun, a colour row's
  three notations, the torrent rows (fold, folder, pause, remove), a grid icon's
  ✕ and the archive queue's ✕.
- Controls that already carry a VISIBLE label do not get one. A tooltip
  repeating the word under the cursor is noise, and it trains people to ignore
  the ones that say something.
- Zone names live in L10n like any other string (`tipSnap*`), so the window
  layouts finally have names in all fifteen languages instead of being glyphs only.

## Architecture and build

- `HopCore` (library, no UI): TimerEngine — a finite state machine
  idle/running/paused/finished + cycles + stash + stopwatch; TimeFormatting.
  Timer logic lives only here and only with tests.
- `Hop` (executable): SwiftUI panel, 5×7 dot font on Canvas,
  settings in UserDefaults, signals (NSSound Glass + UNUserNotificationCenter,
  notifications only work from the .app bundle).
- **One list of modules** — `HopCore.ModuleCatalog`: identity, whether a module
  ships hidden, and what it can be asked to do. The hotkey manager reads it
  instead of spelling the sixteen modules out a second time. A module carries an
  "open" action only where pressing a key SHOWS something without the panel — a
  window of its own (converter, archives, uninstaller) or a change on screen
  (eyedropper, text recognition, keyboard lock), plus the timer and no-sleep
  (Anton, 2026-09-01). The clipboard, the monitor, the tracker, the to-dos and
  the rest are read IN the panel, which has a key of its own, so a second key
  would only open the same panel. The window manager has no "open" at all: its
  EIGHTEEN zones are its actions (`ModuleCatalog.zoneActions`, ids `zone:<name>`,
  storage `hotkey_zone_<name>`, ⌃⌥ defaults in Rectangle's convention), so every
  one of them is rebindable like any other key. The storage keys of the six
  actions that had one (`hotkey_panel`, `hotkey_timer`, `hotkey_awake`,
  `hotkey_color`, `hotkey_ocr`, `hotkey_keyboardLock`) never change — saved
  combinations hang on them; the three window actions ship with no combination,
  because claiming global shortcuts on somebody's behalf is rude.
- **Which combination may be claimed** — `HopCore.HotkeyActivation.registrable`:
  every action of every module that is ON, plus the panel's own, which is never
  withheld — it is how somebody who switched off everything gets back to the
  settings. A module that is switched off claims nothing, and its combination is
  free for another module to take (Anton, 2026-09-05; this reverses the
  2026-09-02 rule under which a hidden module kept its key). The zones carry the
  extra `windowsHotkeysOn` question on top of their module's, silencing all
  eighteen at once while the module is on. The drawing layer's mode key carries
  a question of its own on top of its module's — whether the layer is on screen
  (`drawingLayerUp`, 2026-09-08). `HotkeyManager` claims
  nothing for an action with no handler — a global shortcut that swallows the
  key and does nothing is worse than no shortcut. The hotkeys page lists only
  what a key can reach: a switched-off module's row is not drawn, and the whole
  zones group goes with the windows module.
- Full cycle after EVERY change: `swift build` (0 warnings) →
  `swift test` → `--l10n-check` → `./scripts/build-app.sh --install`,
  check in both themes.
- **The app icon is DRAWN at every size** (`make-icon.sh`, Anton, 2026-09-09).
  The iconset used to be one 1024px render put through `sips`, and scaling
  averaged the round-capped rays with the cream plate behind them: at 128pt the
  asterisk came out soft and grey rather than black. Each size is now rendered
  by `make-icon.swift <file> <size>` in its own right, and the mark is pure
  black — the same black the in-app icon and the SVGs carry.
- **Build times, measured 2026-07-26** (this tree, M-series, cold builds):
  debug 14s · release with `-O` **16m46s** · release with `-Osize` **37s**, and
  the binary is the same 11.6 MB either way. So the app target ships with
  `-Osize` (Package.swift, release only) and HopCore keeps `-O`: at `-O` the
  optimizer hits a pathological case on a 29k-line SwiftUI module and inlines for
  a quarter of an hour to no measurable effect — the work of a menu-bar app
  happens inside AppKit, and Hop's own hot paths are in HopCore. `-Onone` was
  also measured (26s) and rejected: same speed as `-Osize` but a 19 MB binary.
  Whole-module optimization is NOT the culprit: `-no-whole-module-optimization`
  took 17m13s, i.e. no better. Release builds are never incremental in SwiftPM,
  so any one-line change costs the full build — which is exactly why a dev
  install is `--dev` (debug, ~2s) and release builds happen only for a release.
- `--snapshot out.png [--stats|--finished|…]` — renders the panel to PNG;
  Toggle/TextField/onDrop produce artifacts in snapshots — a rendering
  quirk, not a bug. `--window-settings --settings-section <id>` opens any
  settings page (`--news` and `--permissions` are shorthands for two of them),
  so a text change can be checked where it is actually read.
- `--window-uninstall` / `--window-clean` render the uninstaller's two jobs with
  STAGED content: the real lists are this Mac's own apps and this Mac's own disk,
  and a product picture must not be somebody's home folder. A rescan is skipped
  entirely under `Snapshot.active` — it would wipe the staged lists on its way to
  walking that disk.
- `--stats --charts` renders the monitor in chart mode with a SYNTHESIZED
  history (sin-based, deterministic): a live run has two points by render time
  and every card would come out empty. The gpu series is staged too, and the
  gpu ROW is pinned to where its own curve ends — the card appears as soon as
  the Mac reports a load, so on an idle Mac the picture used to show a gpu
  reading with a blank card under it, and a raised curve over a "0%" row is no
  better. The temperature line is staged only where the chip reports one, and
  the monitor does NOT poll under `Snapshot.active`: a refresh would replace the
  staged sample a beat before the render.
- **Lists render in a snapshot through `SnapshotAwareScroll`.** ImageRenderer
  hands a ScrollView an unbounded height, the ScrollView reports nothing back,
  and the picture comes out as a title on black — which is exactly how the first
  render of the clean-up window came out. In a snapshot the rows are laid out
  directly and the caller gives the render its height.
- `--only <module>` leaves ONE module's row on the panel and hides the rest;
  `--overview` does the opposite and shows every module at once, the opt-in
  ones included, with content staged in each (the colour picker draws its
  swatches out of the clipboard history, so the overview seeds a mixed list —
  an empty row in the one picture meant to show the whole app is worse than a
  crowded one). The colours go BELOW the three rows the clipboard shows by
  default: with them on top the shot said "this keeps colours" twice and never
  showed that it also keeps a link, a file and a piece of text (Anton,
  2026-07-30).
- `scripts/make-screens.sh [out-dir] [lang …]` renders the WHOLE product set —
  every README and product-page image, for every `AppLanguage` — into the
  website repo by default. Each README loads the shots in its own language from
  `hop.tools/screens/<lang>/`, the same files the site shows. The recipes used to live nowhere and each shot was taken by
  hand, so the set drifted out of date module by module and a section about the
  timer carried a picture of the entire app (Anton, 2026-07-28). A section that
  describes one module gets a shot of that module: `--only`. Sample files for
  the converter window are generated inside the script, so its rows carry real
  thumbnails and believable size estimates. After a run, bump `SCREENS_VER` in
  the site's `src/views/hop/config.ts` — the image optimizer caches for 31 days
  and the file names are stable.
- Signing: a permanent self-signed "Minimo Signing" certificate —
  permissions survive reinstalls. Ad-hoc fallback only if the certificate
  is missing (undesirable — TCC gets dropped).
- Branches: development happens in `dev`; merge to `main` only on an
  explicit "publish" go-ahead. Version stays 1.0.0 until the first release.
- Download CDN: Bunny pull zone hop-dl (id 6152002), host
  https://hop-dl.b-cdn.net, origin www.antonshakirov.com — on poor routes
  (VPN, distant regions) files download in about a second instead of
  minutes. Landing page links:
  DMG for people — https://hop-dl.b-cdn.net/products/hop/Hop.dmg,
  zip — https://hop-dl.b-cdn.net/downloads/hop/Hop-X.Y.Z.zip.
  release.sh purges the zone cache itself (Hop.dmg is unversioned).
  The updater stays on the direct domain (latest.json is tiny; control
  over it is critical).
- Distribution formats: DMG — for people, from the landing page (the
  "drag to Applications" window); ZIP+sig — for the auto-update channel.
  Both are built by release.sh.
- DMG window: 640×400, icons at (170, 165) and (470, 165), picture 1280×800
  at 144 dpi drawn by make-dmg-bg.swift in the landing's palette (#0b0b0b,
  accent #ffd60a). Finder draws that picture only when it sits inside
  `.background/` on the volume, the icvp alias points at it, and dmgbuild's
  pBBk bookmark record is gone — each of the three was checked on its own
  against freshly built images. With a picture in place Finder also switches
  both icon labels to dark text whatever the system appearance is, so the
  backdrop carries light pads under "Hop" and "Applications". make-dmg.sh
  asserts the whole layout after building.
- After installing an update the app relaunches itself through a rollback
  guard started from the OLD executable before any bundle paths are exchanged.
  The guard must first write a readiness marker; a successful `Process.run()`
  alone is not enough evidence that recovery is alive. It then waits for the old
  process to exit and launches the replacement with `open -n -W`, so a launch
  failure or early crash is observed immediately rather than after a blind
  timeout. The old bundle is kept until the replacement reaches the SAME
  30-second stability point used by `LaunchGuard`. A clean user quit before
  that point is NOT a commit signal: the guard atomically restores the old
  version but leaves it quit. An abnormal early exit restores and relaunches the
  old version. No shell parses updater paths or arguments.
- Auto-check cadence: 15 s after launch, every hour, and 30 s after
  wake from sleep (the quietest moment — the user is just coming back
  and doesn't rely on the app yet). Only the tiny latest.json is fetched
  on each check; the zip downloads only when a newer version is found.
- Install timing: a found release installs at the first moment the user
  isn't actively using Hop, not at the next hourly check. If the check
  finds a release but the moment is busy, it's remembered and a 60 s
  retry (gate-only, no network) installs it the instant the user goes
  idle. "Not in use" = no interaction for 20 minutes AND no running/paused
  timer, sleep-prevention, open panel, or in-progress conversion.
  Interactions that reset the 20-minute window: opening the panel,
  timer/awake hotkeys, opening a window, running a conversion. A
  critical release skips the 20-minute wait and the awake/panel/converter
  checks — but still never interrupts a set timer. The rule lives in
  HopCore's UpdateInstallPolicy (unit-tested).
- Public copy (mirror README, release notes, landing page) — ENGLISH
  ONLY: the project is international.
- Release mirror: https://github.com/antonyshakirov/hop — a public repo
  (created 2026-07-13), Release v1.0.0 with zip+sig; the code is NOT
  published (README stub only) — it goes up on Anton's explicit
  "publish the code" (git remote add + push of the real history on top;
  the release stays). From most regions GitHub's CDN is orders of
  magnitude faster than the origin VPS; a "Download from GitHub" button
  is worth adding to the landing page. New releases are duplicated:
  `gh release create vX.Y.Z Hop-X.Y.Z.zip Hop-X.Y.Z.zip.sig -R antonyshakirov/hop`.
- The dev build does NOT check for updates automatically — it makes no
  network calls and doesn't trip testers' firewalls; it updates by
  rebuilding. "Dev" is ONE shared rule (`Bundle.isDevBuild`): the bundle id is
  not EXACTLY the production id (`…minimo`). That covers the ".dev" parallel
  app AND any bundle-less run (raw `swift build` binary, `--snapshot` probe:
  nil id), so a bundle-less process can never be mistaken for production and
  auto-update. The same rule drives the menu-bar "D" dev-mark and the
  Finder-icon "D" badge (the icon badge is additionally suppressed under
  `--snapshot`, so marketing renders show the production icon). A
  `.dev`-suffix-only heuristic was wrong: it read a nil-id run as production.
- Releases are signed with Developer ID and notarised by Apple as of 1.9.1, so
  the Gatekeeper warning on a first install is gone — see "Signing,
  notarisation, and why permissions must survive an update".
- Updater: watches the GitHub Release (the repo will be antonshakirov/hop),
  the Ed25519 signature is mandatory, disabled until the public key is
  embedded; a silent hourly check, installs at the first moment the user
  isn't actively using Hop (see the install-timing rule above).

## Planned (approved by Anton, not done yet)

1. (done) **Lid without a password every time** via sudoers: a one-time password
   entry installs the rule `/etc/sudoers.d/hop-pmset` (NOPASSWD strictly for
   `pmset disablesleep 0/1`, validated with visudo), after which `sudo -n` runs
   without dialogs. The alternative (an SMAppService daemon + XPC) is deferred to
   avoid maintaining two mechanisms. See "Lid mode without a password" below for
   how the rule is taken back.
2. (done 2026-07-13) Icons in the documentation: DocView renders SF
   Symbols inline via the `{sym:name}` token in the translation string
   (engine in DocView.rich); icons accompany the transport, the clipboard
   expander, and the lid; the lid wording was rewritten in plain language
   in every language.
3. (done 2026-07-13) Clamping the whole panel's height to the screen:
   content is measured with a GeometryReader; when it exceeds the visible
   screen area, a shared fixed-height scroll kicks in.
4. Backlog: ffmpeg formats on user request; Arabic/Hebrew will require
   an RTL pass.

## Checks that run themselves

`scripts/checks.sh` is the check cycle in one place — build (warnings count as
failures), `swift test`, the canvas, export and live-layer self-tests,
`--l10n-check` and `--preparing-version` — and THREE things call it, so they
cannot drift apart (Anton, 2026-08-29):

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push and pull request to `main`
  AND `dev`. It used to watch `main` only, which meant the branch all the work
  actually happens on had no automatic checks at all.
- **The local pre-push hook**, so nothing red leaves the machine.
  `HOP_SKIP_CHECKS=1 git push` is the escape hatch for a known-good docs fix.
  Like the other hooks it lives in `.git/hooks` and is restored by hand after a
  re-clone.
- **`release.sh`**, right after it has validated its arguments and found the
  signing key, and before it packages anything: a release that fails its own
  checks is not a release.

## Repo workflow

- **Exactly ONE working session edits the repo at a time.** A second
  session is read-only/consulting. Parallel edits have already caused
  regressions: one session's commits picked up the other's unfinished
  files, builds failed with "modified during build", and fixed things
  got overwritten (the clipboard height ceiling).
- A behavior change = an edit to this file in the same commit.
- One commit = one feature/fix; `git add` only with an explicit file list,
  never `git add -A` / `commit -am` — otherwise the commit drags in
  someone else's work.

## App icon (Finder)
Style: auto / dark / light (settings → general). Applied via
NSWorkspace.setIcon on the bundle; "auto" follows the system theme.
The menu bar icon is always a monochrome system template.

## Language picker
A dropdown with search (settings panel and onboarding): matches by native
name, English name, and code (e.g. typing "German" finds "Deutsch").
The list shows only the native names; "same as system" is written in the
system language. Order — alphabetical by native names.

## Speed test
A main-panel module (hideable/reorderable like the rest). The "test"
button → the system `/usr/bin/networkQuality -c` (Apple CDN servers,
~15–20 s) → a "↓ N · ↑ M Mbit/s · RPM" row. Repeat via the ↻ icon. No
custom servers and no third-party services. A fresh result is drawn in the
primary ink, like the module's own name: it is the answer the row exists for,
and in secondary grey it read as a caption (Anton, 2026-09-05). A stale one
(30+ minutes, or another network) stays faded.

## Memory (monitor)
Reworked 2026-07-15 (Anton): the old "(used+swap)/RAM %" threshold read
as if swap were on top of the shown figure and lied about pressure. Now:
- The row shows RAM used ("18.0 / 24.0 GB") with swap alongside when
  > 50 MB ("swap 4.9 GB") — the figures no longer include each other.
- **Each figure carries its own verdict** (Anton, 2026-09-06). The used figure
  follows macOS's pressure signal alone; the swap figure follows the share of RAM
  sitting on disk alone. They used to share the worse of the two, so a machine
  quietly holding a third of its memory in swap painted "20.2 / 24.0" red while
  the pressure level said normal — the red was true about the swap and false
  about the RAM.
- "Used" matches Activity Monitor's Memory Used, computed the way its bar is
  built: Physical Memory − Cached Files − free, i.e.
  `hw.memsize − ((free_count − speculative) + file-backed) × page`
  (`HopCore.MemoryUsage.usedBytes`). Both subtracted terms were measured
  against a live Activity Monitor reading (2026-07-27, 24 GiB machine, Used
  20.98 GB): Cached Files is `external_page_count` ALONE, and free is
  `free_count` MINUS `speculative_count`, because Mach's `free_count` already
  contains the speculative pages — that is why `vm_stat` prints the two apart.
  This is the additive App Memory + wired + compressed sum PLUS the
  kernel/hardware-reserved pages `host_statistics64` files in no queue — on
  Apple Silicon the GPU/firmware carve-out of unified memory (0.78 GB measured)
  — plus the speculative and purgeable pages Activity Monitor also counts as
  used. Three formulas have been wrong here in turn: an active_count one ran
  ~2 GB under (fixed 2026-07-18), the additive sum ~0.9 GB under (fixed
  2026-07-22), and the first subtractive one deducted purgeable pages as cache
  and speculative pages twice, so it drifted under by however much of each the
  machine held — up to about a gigabyte (fixed 2026-07-27). Subtraction
  degrades cleanly where there is no carve-out (reserved ≈ 0), matching the
  additive sum.
- The COLOR takes the WORSE of two signals (`HopCore.MemoryStrain`), because
  each is blind to what the other sees:
  - macOS's own `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`: 1 normal (green when
    colorful), 2 warning → yellow, 4 critical → red. It answers "am I
    struggling to hand out pages right now" and nothing else.
  - Swap as a share of physical RAM, against a user threshold
    (`thSwapYellow` / `thSwapRed`, defaults 25 / 50). Pages pushed to disk that
    have stayed cold cost the system nothing, so the pressure level keeps
    reporting normal while a great deal of memory sits in swap: measured on a
    24 GB machine holding 9.4 GB of swap, the level was still 1 (Anton,
    2026-07-28). That is a fact about the machine the user can act on, so the
    row says it.
- Swap is compared to RAM and NOT to the size of the swap file: macOS grows
  that file on demand, so "92% of the file" becomes "46%" the moment it grows
  with nothing about the machine having changed.
- This is NOT a return of the pre-2026-07-15 rule. That one coloured on
  `(used + swap) ÷ RAM` with yellow at 110%: it added a figure that already
  counts compressed memory to a pool living on disk and compared the sum to the
  size of RAM. A "normal" threshold above 100% is the tell that the metric had
  no physical meaning. The keys `thMemYellow` / `thMemRed` are swept, and the
  new ones are named apart so an inherited 110 cannot become "warn when swap
  passes 110% of RAM", which is silence.
- Memory is deliberately NOT part of the menu-bar icon's red zone, as it has
  never been: swap fills over hours rather than spiking, so a badge for it
  would sit there all day and stop meaning anything.

## Safe mode (crash loop)

A bug that crashes the app on launch must not cut off the path to an
update containing the fix.

- Every launch increments the `launchAttempts` counter (UserDefaults)
  BEFORE the model and modules are initialized. The counter resets after
  30 seconds of stable operation and on a clean exit
  (`applicationWillTerminate`).
- Three unfinished launches in a row = safe mode: the model, modules and
  SwiftUI are not created at all. In the menu bar — a "⚠" icon with an
  AppKit menu: the title "Hop — safe mode", a hint, the check status,
  "check & update", "quit".
- On entering safe mode, an update is checked for and installed
  automatically (the manual UpdateChecker path, bypassing the timer
  restrictions).
- If safe mode crashes too, the counter keeps growing — the next launch
  is safe mode again.
- The counter logic is `LaunchGuard`, covered by tests.


## Parallel dev build (after the 1.0.0 release)

Anton's primary install must always remain fully functional.

- `/Applications/Hop.app` (bundle id com.antonshakirov.minimo) is the
  stable one, updated only by releases (after "publish") or by auto-update.
- Day-to-day changes go into the parallel "Hop Dev.app":
  `./scripts/build-app.sh --install --dev` — its own bundle id
  (…minimo.dev), its own name and its own settings; it doesn't touch the
  main install and doesn't kill its process (pkill only by its own
  bundle path).
- Until the first release, `--install` still updates Hop.app directly.

## The about page (settings window)

- What the app is has no window of its own any more. The ⓘ button in the panel
  header and the right-click menu's "about" item open the SETTINGS window on its
  "about" page; a release card's "what's new" opens the UPDATES page, where the
  notes now live (`model.settingsSectionRequest`, consumed once by the window,
  which otherwise remembers the page it was left on).
- **The page answers "what is this and who do I write to"** (Anton, 2026-09-02):
  the donation card (still the only donation surface in the product), then
  support — the mail address and the Telegram bot, in a card of their own rather
  than a line of footer nobody reads — then "how hop works" (`aboutHowTitle` /
  `aboutHowBody`, ×10): four short paragraphs saying where Hop lives, that the
  panel is built of modules sitting on spaces, that each module has a page here
  and a key of its own, and that nothing leaves the Mac. The footer keeps
  version, source, the author's site and the product page.
- **Release notes belong to the updates page**, with the auto-update switch, the
  check button and the version: the whole history of what shipped is what
  somebody on that page came for, and "about" was carrying it for no reason.
- **The per-module documentation is back in the app** (Anton, 2026-09-02), the
  same twenty-one strings ×10 that 1.9.1 had moved out to the site (e807a79),
  restored from that commit. What made them dead weight was the WINDOW they
  lived in — fourteen tabs nobody opened. Now each text sits under the settings
  of the module it describes, where somebody is already looking at that module,
  and all of them together make the handbook page. The site's guide stays, one
  link under each of them, for the 8 languages it is published in.

- **Spacing says what belongs together** (Anton, 2026-09-02). `DocView` measures
  the gap ABOVE each block from what it follows: 9pt between two items of the
  same list, 17pt where a paragraph meets a paragraph or a list starts or ends,
  26pt above a release heading, against 5pt between the wrapped lines inside one
  block. One flat 10 made a bullet's own second line and the next bullet the
  same distance apart, and the page read as one grey slab. A rule closes the
  settings above "how it works" on a module page, as between the handbook's
  sections, and the heading keeps 6pt of its own before the text starts.
- **A section inside a page is mono 13 semibold in the page's ink**
  (`settingsSectionHeader`) — one step under the 15pt page heading. At the old
  mono 10 tertiary a heading like "how it works" vanished above a wall of 12pt
  body text (Anton, 2026-09-02). `SettingsGroupLabel` (mono 9, uppercase,
  tertiary) stays what it is: the caption ABOVE a card, not a heading inside a
  page.

## The handbook page (settings window)

- Sixth in the sidebar, between updates and about: `docGeneral` (what Hop is,
  the panel, the spaces, the menu bar) followed by every module's own text in
  catalog order, each under its name, then the grids of apps, then the link to
  the site's guide. One place to read the whole thing straight through, without
  a window of its own and without going to the site (Anton, 2026-09-02).
- The texts are NOT duplicated: the page and the module pages read the same
  `ModulePresentation.howKeys`, so a correction lands in both.
- It does not render as a snapshot — the page is taller than `ImageRenderer`
  will draw at scale 2, and `--snapshot --settings-section guide` says so
  instead of writing a file. In the window it is a normal scrolling page.

## Versioning (approved 2026-07-13)

Semver MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, starting at 1.0.0. The version changes only at
release time (on "publish"): `scripts/Info.plist` carries the number last
released until `release.sh` stamps the new one.

**A dev build carries the release it is preparing** (Anton, 2026-09-10). A dev
build that read 2.0.3 from the plist showed the 2.0 card while 2.1 was being
written, since a card waits for its version to be installed. `build-app.sh --dev`
stamps the number `Hop --preparing-version` prints instead, read from the head of
the English release notes (`docNews`, "2.1.0 – date"); the repository's plist is
not touched. `ReleaseNews.preparing` (`ReleaseNewsTests`) refuses notes that do
not open with three numbers, a release card newer than the notes, and a minor
release without a card of its own. `checks.sh` fails on any of them, and
`release.sh` refuses a number other than the one the notes name and a
CHANGELOG.md that does not open with it.

**A fix card that catches up** (Anton, 2026-09-16). A card may name the release
card it follows (`catchUp`). Somebody who never had that card drawn — no press,
no showing, no clock started — came from an older release, and the fix card
opens with the older card's lines before its own; somebody who saw it gets only
the new lines. The answer is stored under `newsCatchUp.<id>` on the first
showing, because that showing marks the older card seen and the lines must not
change under the reader. `ReleaseNews.needsCatchUp` (`ReleaseNewsTests`).
Snapshot: `--news-banner --news-catch-up`.

**A released number is never reissued** (2026-09-17). 2.1.1 shipped the 2.1.0
binary: Swift 6.4 moved the universal build to `.build/out/Products`, and
`build-app.sh` copied from the old folder. The number, the signature,
notarisation and `verify-release.sh` were all right, the code was not. An update
compares numbers, so a Mac on the broken 2.1.1 would never take a fixed 2.1.1;
the fix went out as 2.1.2. `build-app.sh` now takes the path from
`swift build --show-bin-path` and refuses a binary older than any source file.

**Release notes headings.** "X.Y.Z – date" opens a version: 26pt above it, 9pt
below, so a date reads with its own items and not with the release before
(Anton, 2026-09-17; the heading test expected an em dash while the notes carry
an en dash, so every gap was the same 17pt). Every date in one language's notes
is written the way its newest one is.

- PATCH (+0.0.1) — fixes with no new behavior: bugs, crashes, translations,
  cosmetics. Auto-update installs it silently.
- MINOR (+0.1.0) — anything new that is visible to the eye: a module,
  a setting, a noticeable behavior/design change. PATCH resets to 0.
- MAJOR (2.0.0) — rare, meaning "the app has been rethought": a big
  redesign, a paid version, a compatibility break (settings migration,
  dropping old macOS versions).
- A release = merge to main + git tag vX.Y.Z + a line in CHANGELOG.md
  (in plain language; it doubles as the release notes) + a zip with an
  Ed25519 signature.
- `[critical]` in the release description — crash/security: the updater
  installs it at the first opportunity.
- The next release number is suggested from the commits since the last tag:
  fixes only — patch; anything new — minor.
- Cadence (Anton's rule, 2026-07-13): the first week after 1.0.0 —
  releases may be more frequent (shakedown period); after that NO more
  often than once every two days, aiming for once a week — changes
  accumulate in dev and ship as a batch.
  Exception — critical issues (crash/security): publish immediately
  with the critical flag.

## Update channel (production path, since 1.0.0)

- Manifest: `https://hop.tools/downloads/hop/latest.json` (version, zip,
  sig, critical, date, mirrors); the archive and signature sit next to it.
  The old address `https://www.antonshakirov.com/downloads/hop/latest.json`,
  which every build before 1.10.0 asks for, answers 301 to the one above so
  those copies keep updating.
- Whether the manifest offers something newer is `UpdateFeed.isNewer`
  (`UpdateFeedTests`), comparing the numbers rather than the text — 1.10.0 stands
  above 1.9.1 while the strings sort the other way round, and every Mac's update
  to 1.10.0 rides on it. It lives in HopCore beside `ReleaseNews.Version`, which
  does the parsing, so the app and the release cards agree on what a version is.
  A string that is not a version answers false: no build is replaced on a reading
  nobody can make sense of.
- Mirrors (since 2.0.0). The hosts a download may come from are
  `DownloadMirrors.hosts` — `hop.tools`, then `ru.hop.tools` — and every
  fetch walks them in order (`MirrorFetch`), treating anything but a 200 as
  no answer. It covers the manifest, the build, its signature and the three
  helper manifests alike; the host that answers is asked for the rest of the
  same download. A machine can be unreachable from a whole country without
  being down, and an update that asks one host stops arriving for those
  people entirely.
  - The fallback host is built INTO the app, not carried in the manifest: a
    mirror list inside `latest.json` cannot help when it is `latest.json`
    that fails to arrive. `mirrors` in the manifest only ADDS hosts, which
    is how one can be introduced without an app update; entries that are not
    plain host names are ignored (`DownloadMirrorsTests`).
  - A mirror cannot change what gets installed: the Ed25519 check stands
    between the download and the install, and it is the same key on every
    host.
- Release: `scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z [--critical]` → the build, its
  signature and `latest.json` are rsynced to `downloads/hop/` on EVERY
  mirror, manifest last → the site's version number is committed and
  deployed → `scripts/verify-release.sh X.Y.Z` → `git tag vX.Y.Z` + GitHub
  release.
- Nothing is announced before the files serve: verify-release.sh downloads
  the LIVE latest.json, the exact zip it points to, checks the 64-byte
  signature file and the bundle version inside the zip, and the landing
  DMG — the tag and the GitHub release are created only after it passes.
  (1.3.1 lesson: Next's public manifest 404s NEW file names until a site
  rebuild; the deploy self-probes changed public paths and rebuilds now.)
- Installation only with a valid Ed25519 signature (the key is embedded
  in the app; the private half is `~/.minimo-release-key`, outside the repo).
- The production `/Applications/Hop.app` is updated ONLY through this
  channel; `build-app.sh --install` without `--dev`/`--prod` refuses
  to install.
- The test build is "Hop Dev.app" (`--install --dev`), living in parallel;
  its icon carries a gold "D" badge in the bottom-right corner so the
  production and test builds can't be confused.
- The downloaded archive is still extracted under
  `temporaryDirectory/hop-update-<UUID>`; each launch sweeps those temporary
  leftovers. The VERIFIED app is then copied with `ditto` to a hidden sibling
  of the production bundle,
  `/Applications/.Hop-update-rollback-<transaction>.app`, and verified AGAIN
  there. This second copy is mandatory because the object about to be installed,
  not merely its source in /tmp, is what must satisfy the version, architecture,
  bundle-ID and Developer-ID invariants.
- Replacement is an atomic directory-entry exchange with macOS `RENAME_SWAP`.
  Both bundles are on the same filesystem before the exchange. There is NO
  remove-then-copy or remove-then-move fallback: at every instant
  `/Applications/Hop.app` names one complete bundle. After the exchange the
  hidden sibling is the known-good OLD app.
- The replacement is verified once more at the canonical path. Its Info.plist is
  read directly from disk rather than through `Bundle(url:)`, because the
  running old process still owns `Bundle.main` and Foundation may cache bundle
  metadata across a path swap. The code signature is re-checked at that final
  path as well.
- The rollback guard owns the old bundle until the new app proves a stable
  launch. If the replacement exits before acknowledgement or cannot be launched,
  the guard uses the same atomic `RENAME_SWAP` to put the old app back and then
  relaunches it. If even the rollback exchange fails, BOTH bundles are preserved;
  the guard never deletes the last known-good copy.
- Because code may roll back during that stability window, any launch-time
  persistent-data migration introduced by a release MUST remain readable by the
  immediately previous release until the 30-second acknowledgement commits the
  update. A schema change that cannot satisfy that rule must use a dual-readable
  representation or defer its irreversible step until after update commitment.
  Binary rollback without data compatibility is not a complete rollback.
- On launch, transaction garbage collection is deliberately conservative.
  A transaction is cleaned only when `launch-stable` proves it committed, or
  when `guard-ready` was never written and therefore the atomic swap gate was
  never reached. A ready-but-unacknowledged transaction is preserved intact;
  it may still be active or may contain the only recovery copy.
- The hidden guard/acknowledgement launch modes are path-constrained to
  `/Applications/Hop.app`, the matching hidden rollback sibling, and Hop's own
  cache transaction directory. They are not general-purpose rename/write
  primitives.


## Converter: window height and audio

- Window height = content + title bar inset (fullSizeContentView), up to
  75% of the screen; content is measured directly with
  GeometryReader.onAppear/onChange (a PreferenceKey through ScrollView
  returned 0). Programmatic resizing is recognized by the expected height
  (converterExpectedHeight), not by a temporary flag: didResize arrives
  asynchronously and the flag didn't survive long enough.
- Audio: exactly one output format — M4A (AAC); macOS has no built-in
  MP3/FLAC encoders, and we don't embed ffmpeg. The UI shows the single
  active chip with an explanatory hint rather than an empty row.
- Video: the "compress" quality = HEVC at the source resolution (~−40%
  size); the file's resolution ("1080p"/"4K", by the short side) is shown
  in the row; during export — a linear bar and percentages straight from
  the encoder (session.progress, polled every 300 ms).
- Video size estimates come from a real sample encode: the first ~8 s of
  the file go through the actual export preset and the result extrapolates
  by duration ("original" — the source size, container change only).
  Estimates are marked "~" and never exceed the source size.

## Timer: finish sound and calm-down

The finish sound fires EXACTLY ONCE per finish (`engine.onFinish` →
`Alerts.fire` → `Sounds.alarm`). There is no repeat timer — the earlier
3-second `startAlarmRepeat` loop (auto-muted after `alarmRepeatSeconds`) was
the source of the "fires several times" behavior and has been removed, along
with the now-unused `alarmRepeatSeconds` default.

The finished state signals in two phases — an alarm, then a calm reminder — so
it stays obvious the timer needs a reset without the alarm nagging on:

- **Fresh finish — the alarm blink.** The menu-bar bell blinks and the zeroed
  digits blink in the panel (`engine.isFinishBlinking`, true while finished and
  not yet acknowledged). The ticker drives both, and both the bar bell
  (`StatusItemController.refreshButton`) and the panel digits (`AppModel.blinkOn`)
  derive their blink from `engine.isFinishBlinking`.
- **Opening the panel acknowledges the finish** (`presentPopover` →
  `TimerEngine.acknowledgeFinish`): the alarm settles — the menu-bar bell stops
  blinking and holds a steady `bell.fill`, and the finish sound was one-shot
  anyway. The state stays `.finished`. Acknowledgment is idempotent and a no-op
  off the finished state; every fresh finish clears the flag and blinks anew.
- **After acknowledge — the calm pulse.** The bell is gone, but the zeroed
  digits keep a subtle pulse (`engine.isFinishSettled`, i.e. finished AND
  acknowledged) — dimming and returning via `AppModel.finishedPulseOpacity`, a
  gentle "it finished, reset it" reminder rather than a full-disappear blink.
  The ticker keeps running to drive it; the pulse is tick-driven opacity, never
  a `repeatForever` SwiftUI animation (which would break the popover sizing). It
  runs across all three display styles (dots/text/units) and both themes. It does
  NOT touch the menu bar: the bar shows the steady bell and no time text for a
  finished timer, so nothing there pulses.
- **The pulse ends** the instant the finished state ends — a reset, a new start,
  or digit entry (`engine.reset` / `start` / `setDuration`) all stop the ticker
  and exit the `.finished` state.
- **Clicking the finished digits** (full display and compact row) resets the
  timer to the configured duration (`engine.reset`), leaving the finished
  state entirely and ending the pulse. Per-digit-group editing by click becomes
  available from the next click, already in idle.

## Timer: pause media on finish

The "pause media on finish" toggle (timer settings, off by default).
When the timer finishes, BEFORE the signal: if anything is playing through
the output device (CoreAudio kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere),
we send a genuine MediaRemote "pause" (loaded dynamically, private API),
falling back to the ⏯ media key on failure. On silence we do nothing —
a toggle must never START music. The "got it" click does not resume
playback.

### Panel/help details pinned 2026-07-14

- Compact timer transport tracks the DIGIT SIZE setting, not the layout:
  small digits → play/pause 27pt (icon 10) and reset 21pt (icon 9);
  large digits → 34pt/26pt as before.
- The windows module page → "resize windows with hotkeys": under the toggle sits
  a legend "zone glyph + ⌃⌥ key", four columns (`snapHotkeyItems`), replacing the
  old cryptic symbols-only caption.
- App icon (Finder/Applications): dark or light chip with the REAL icon
  previews, light is the default; "auto" removed. The row sits after the
  updates section, away from the theme picker (it kept reading as part of
  the theme). setIcon failure rolls the Finder custom-icon flag back —
  a half-written icon rendered the app as a folder.

### Signing, notarisation, and why permissions must survive an update

macOS ties a permission — full disk access above all — to the app's CODE
SIGNATURE. Hop is signed with **Developer ID Application: Anton Shakirov
(8GL36WUJPX)**, and a stable certificate is the whole reason a grant survives an
update: the designated requirement names the certificate, which does not change
between builds. An ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) pins the requirement to
the build's own hash instead, so every update is a DIFFERENT app to the system
and every user is asked for every permission again (Anton, 2026-07-30).

Developer ID is also the only signature Gatekeeper accepts from outside the App
Store, and only once Apple has NOTARISED the build. Until 1.9.1 releases were
signed with a self-signed local certificate ("Minimo Signing"), which kept
permissions alive but left every first install blocked behind the "cannot be
opened" dialog and the Privacy & Security override.

- One-time cost of the move: the signature changed, so every permission granted
  to the old builds is gone on the machines that update to 1.9.1 — the system
  sees a different app. The release card in the panel says so; nothing else can,
  since the app is not asked before the system decides.
- `signing.sh` holds the identity, the runtime options and the entitlements in
  ONE place, sourced by both scripts, so a build and the release made from it
  cannot drift apart. The certificate is looked up by kind ("Developer ID
  Application"), so a renewal needs no edit.
- The hardened runtime (`--options runtime`) is required by the notary service
  and is on for dev builds too, so anything that only breaks under it surfaces
  while a change is being looked at. It costs one entitlement:
  `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` in `scripts/Hop.entitlements`,
  without which the iWork export and the lid switch lose their Apple events.
  `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` accompanies it in `Info.plist` — a process
  that sends an Apple event without one is killed by the system.
- `build-app.sh` signs with that identity and falls back to ad-hoc only for a
  local build with no certificate present.
- `release.sh` proves the certificate, its expiry and the notary credentials
  BEFORE the 25-minute build. It thins the universal build into two bundles,
  which invalidates the signature — so it signs each slice again, submits it,
  staples the ticket into the bundle, and asks `spctl` what the user's Mac will
  decide. Both DMGs are signed, notarised and stapled in turn. A missing
  certificate, a rejected submission or refused credentials all stop the release.
- Notary credentials live in a git-ignored `.env` (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`,
  `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` — an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com, never
  the account password). `.env.example` is the template.
- `verify-release.sh` re-checks the SERVED copy: it downloads what `latest.json`
  points to, runs `spctl` over it and validates the stapled ticket, on the app
  and on the landing DMG. A build that is signed but not notarised passes every
  other check and is still blocked on a first install.
- Before the updater removes quarantine or touches the installed app, the
  extracted bundle must pass a strict `codesign` verification against an explicit
  Developer ID requirement: Apple-issued Developer ID Application code for
  `com.antonshakirov.minimo`, Team ID `8GL36WUJPX`. Archive-level Ed25519
  verification alone is not enough. An ad-hoc build, an Apple Development build,
  another team's build, or a damaged signature fails closed and the update is not
  installed.
- `ditto` is used to carry the verified candidate bundle to its same-volume
  staging sibling with extended attributes, ACLs and symlinks intact. Installation
  itself is the atomic directory swap described in the update-channel section;
  the updater never deletes the live production bundle before its replacement is
  complete and independently verified.
